In our book chapters [Replicating Fama and French Factors (R Version)](../../r/replicating-fama-and-french-factors) and [Replicating Fama and French Factors (Python Version)](../../python/replicating-fama-and-french-factors), we show how to construct factor portfolios that are fairly close to the popular data from [Prof. Kenneth French finance data library](https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html). In this blog post, I want to elaborate a bit more on the subtle difference between the size data in the Fama-French three (FF3)[^1] and five (FF5)[^2] factor data. 

## Analyzing monthly factor data

I first start by downloading the monthly Fama-French factors using the `frenchdata` package. The currently available data ranges from July 1926 to August 2023. `1926-07-01` to `2023-08-01`.

```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(frenchdata)
library(fixest)

start_date <- "1926-07-01"
end_date <- "2023-08-01"

factors_ff3_monthly_raw <- download_french_data("Fama/French 3 Factors")
factors_ff3_monthly <- factors_ff3_monthly_raw$subsets$data[[1]] |>
  mutate(
    month = floor_date(ymd(str_c(date, "01")), "month"),
    across(c(RF, `Mkt-RF`, SMB, HML), ~as.numeric(.) / 100),
    .keep = "none"
  ) |>
  rename_with(str_to_lower) |>
  rename(mkt_excess = `mkt-rf`)

factors_ff5_monthly_raw <- download_french_data("Fama/French 5 Factors (2x3)")
factors_ff5_monthly <- factors_ff5_monthly_raw$subsets$data[[1]] |>
  mutate(
    month = floor_date(ymd(str_c(date, "01")), "month"),
    across(c(RF, `Mkt-RF`, SMB, HML, RMW, CMA), ~as.numeric(.) / 100),
    .keep = "none"
  ) |>
  rename_with(str_to_lower) |>
  rename(mkt_excess = `mkt-rf`) 

factors_ff_monthly <- factors_ff3_monthly |> 
  rename_with(.cols = c(mkt_excess, rf, smb, hml),
              ~str_c(.x, "_ff3")) |> 
  inner_join(
    factors_ff5_monthly |> 
      select(month, mkt_excess, rf, smb, hml) |> 
      rename_with(.cols = c(mkt_excess, rf, smb, hml),
              ~str_c(.x, "_ff5")), by = "month") |> 
  filter(month >= start_date & month <= end_date)

industries_ff_monthly_raw <- download_french_data("10 Industry Portfolios")
industries_ff_monthly <- industries_ff_monthly_raw$subsets$data[[1]] |>
  mutate(month = floor_date(ymd(str_c(date, "01")), "month")) |>
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ . / 100)) |>
  select(month, everything(), -date) |>
  rename_with(str_to_lower)
```

Let us first inspect the summary statistics of each factor.

```{r}
factors_ff_monthly |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = - month) |> 
  select(name, value) |>
  drop_na() |>
  group_by(name) |>
  summarize(
    mean = mean(value),
    sd = sd(value),
    min = min(value),
    q05 = quantile(value, 0.05),
    q50 = quantile(value, 0.50),
    q95 = quantile(value, 0.95),
    max = max(value),
    n = n()
  ) |> 
  print(n = Inf)
```

The above table shows that risk free rates `rf_*`, market excess returns `mkt_excess_*`, and value factors `hml_*` show de facto identical value across all statistics for FF3 and FF5. However, the size factors `smb_*`  seem to be different between the data sets. Another way to show the difference is running regressions, as we do in our replication chapters:

```{r}
model_smb <- lm(smb_ff3 ~ smb_ff5, data = factors_ff_monthly)
summary(model_smb)
```

Regressing the FF3 size factor on its FF5 counterpart yields a coefficient of `r round(model_smb$coefficients[2], 2)` and an R-squared around `r round(summary(model_smb)$adj.r.squared, 2) * 100`%, so definitely no perfect co-movement. 

Is this difference just an artifact in the data, limited to a certain time period? Figure @fig-1 shows that there are differences throughout the whole sample.

```{r}
#| label: fig-1
#| fig-cap: "End-of-month difference between monthly size factors from Fama-French three (FF3) and five (FF5) factor data."
#| fig-alt: "Title: Difference between monthly size factors from FF3 and FF5 data. The figure shows a bar chart  of end-of-month differences between monthly size factors Fama-French three (FF3) and five (FF5) data. The figure demonstrates that the differences exist throughout the full period from 1926 to 2023."
factors_ff_monthly |> 
  mutate(difference = smb_ff3 - smb_ff5) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = difference, fill = difference > 0)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "10 years", date_labels = "%Y") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") + 
  labs(
    x = NULL, y = "smb_ff3 - smb_ff5",
    title = "Difference between monthly size factors from FF3 and FF5 data"
  )
```

Where does this difference come from? In my opinion, there is one likelyexplanation for the differences: the size portfolios `portfolio_size` and value portfolios `portfolio_bm` are constructed as independent sorts in FF3, while `portfolio_bm`, `portfolio_op`, and `portfolio_inv` are the result of dependent sorts in FF5 (depending on `portfolio_size`). In FF5, `portfolio_size` is then calculated on averages based on `portfolio_bm`, `portfolio_op`, and `portfolio_inv` portfolios. As all portfolios are the result of value-weighted return aggregation, it is hence very likely that these aggregations lead to different values. 

These subtle differences might even impact your statistical tests. As an example, let us consider one of the industry portfolios from `industry_ff_monthly`. We use the 'other' portfolio, which contains sectors such as mines, construction, entertainment, finance, etc. We run a gression of the corresponding industry portfolios against the market, size, and value factors of FF3 and FF5, respectively.

```{r}
industry_returns <- industries_ff_monthly |> 
  select(month, ret_other = other) |> 
  inner_join(factors_ff_monthly, by = "month")

model_ff3 <- feols(
  ret_other ~ mkt_excess_ff3 + smb_ff3 + hml_ff3, 
  industry_returns
)

model_ff5 <- feols(
  ret_other ~ mkt_excess_ff5 + smb_ff5 + hml_ff5, 
  industry_returns
)

etable(model_ff3, model_ff5, coefstat = "tstat")
```

The results show that the size factor is only significant at the 5% level for the FF3 data, but it is significant at the 1% level for the FF5 version!

## A quick look at daily factors

Let us take a quick look at the daily factors to check whether the difference in size premia exists there as well. If my explanation for the difference is correct, then there should be differences. We can download the daily factor data in a similar fashion as the monthly data. 

```{r}
#| message: false
factors_ff3_daily_raw <- download_french_data("Fama/French 3 Factors [Daily]")
factors_ff3_daily <- factors_ff3_daily_raw$subsets$data[[1]] |>
  mutate(
    date = ymd(date),
    across(c(RF, `Mkt-RF`, SMB, HML), ~as.numeric(.) / 100),
    .keep = "none"
  ) |>
  rename_with(str_to_lower) |>
  rename(mkt_excess = `mkt-rf`)

factors_ff5_daily_raw <- download_french_data("Fama/French 5 Factors (2x3) [Daily]")
factors_ff5_daily <- factors_ff5_daily_raw$subsets$data[[1]] |>
  mutate(
    date = ymd(date),
    across(c(RF, `Mkt-RF`, SMB, HML, RMW, CMA), ~as.numeric(.) / 100),
    .keep = "none"
  ) |>
  rename_with(str_to_lower) |>
  rename(mkt_excess = `mkt-rf`) 

factors_ff_daily <- factors_ff3_daily |> 
  rename_with(.cols = c(mkt_excess, rf, smb, hml),
              ~str_c(.x, "_ff3")) |> 
  inner_join(
    factors_ff5_daily |> 
      select(date, mkt_excess, rf, smb, hml) |> 
      rename_with(.cols = c(mkt_excess, rf, smb, hml),
              ~str_c(.x, "_ff5")), by = "date")  |> 
  filter(date >= start_date & date <= end_date)

model_smb <- lm(smb_ff3 ~ smb_ff5, data = factors_ff_daily)
summary(model_smb)
```

Regressing the FF3 size factor on its FF5 counterpart yields a coefficient of `r round(model_smb$coefficients[2], 2)` and an R-squared around `r round(summary(model_smb)$adj.r.squared, 2) * 100`%, so again no perfect co-movement. Unreported results of the distributions and differences over time confirm the regression results and are in line with differences among monthly factor data.

## Conclusion

Are there any implications for empirical applications? In my opinion, you should be careful when you want to test your portfolios against FF3 and FF5 factors. It is strictly speaking not correct to just use a subsample of factors from FF5 if you want to test against the FF3 factors. I rather recommend downloading both FF3 and FF5 and run tests with each data set separately.
