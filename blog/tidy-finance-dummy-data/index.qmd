Since we published our book [Tidy Finance with R](../../r/index.qmd), we have received feedback from readers who don't have access to WRDS that they cannot run the code we provide. To alleviate their constraints, we decided to create a dummy database that contains the WRDS tables and corresponding columns such that all code chunks in our book can be executed with this dummy database. The resulting database can be found through [this link](https://github.com/tidy-finance/website/tree/main/blog/tidy-finance-dummy-data/data) (around 50 MB). Just download the database and put it into your `data` folder (I already renamed it to `tidy_finance.sqlite`). Note that we do not create dummy data for macro tables because they can be freely downloaded from the original sources - check out [Accessing and Managing Financial Data](../../r/accessing-and-managing-financial-data.qmd).

We deliberately use the *dummy* label because the data is not meaningful in the sense that it allows readers to actually replicate the results of the book. For legal reasons, the data does *not* contain any samples of the original data. We merely generate random numbers for all columns of the tables that we use throughout the books. 

::: {.callout-note}
If you want to see the Python code to generate the dummy data, check out the chapter in the appendix of our book: [WRDS Dummy Data](../../python/wrds-dummy-data.qmd).
:::

To generate the dummy database, we use the following packages:

```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(RSQLite)
```

Let us initialize a `tidy_finance.sqlite` database or connect to your existing one. Be careful, if you already downloaded the data from WRDS, then the code in this blog post will overwrite your data!

```{r}
tidy_finance <- dbConnect(
  SQLite(),
  "data/tidy_finance.sqlite",
  extended_types = TRUE
)
```

Since we draw random numbers for most of the columns, we also define a seed to ensure that the generated numbers are replicable. We also initialize vectors of dates of different frequencies over 10 years that we then use to create yearly, monthly, and daily data, respectively. 

```{r}
set.seed(1234)

start_date <- as.Date("2003-01-01")
end_date <- as.Date("2022-12-31")

time_series_years <- seq(year(start_date), year(end_date), 1)
time_series_months <- seq(start_date, end_date, "1 month")
time_series_days <- seq(start_date, end_date, "1 day")
```

## Create stock dummy data

Let us start with the core data used throughout the book: stock and firm characteristics. We first generate a table with a cross-section of stock identifiers with unique `permno` and `gvkey` values, as well as associated `exchcd`, `exchange`, `industry`, and `siccd` values. The generated data is based on the characteristics of stocks in the `crsp_monthly` table of the original database, ensuring that the generated stocks roughly reflect the distribution of industries and exchanges in the original data, but the identifiers and corresponding exchanges or industries do not reflect actual firms. Similarly, the `permno`-`gvkey` combinations are purely nonsensical and should not be used together with actual CRSP or Compustat data. 

```{r}
number_of_stocks <- 100

industries <- tibble(
  industry = c("Agriculture", "Construction", "Finance", 
               "Manufacturing", "Mining", "Public", "Retail", 
               "Services", "Transportation", "Utilities", 
               "Wholesale"),
  n = c(81, 287, 4682, 8584, 1287, 1974, 1571, 4277, 1249, 
        457, 904),
  prob = c(0.00319, 0.0113, 0.185, 0.339, 0.0508, 0.0779, 
           0.0620, 0.169, 0.0493, 0.0180, 0.0357)
)

exchanges <- exchanges <- tibble(
  exchange = c("AMEX", "NASDAQ", "NYSE"),
  n = c(2893, 17236, 5553),
  prob = c(0.113, 0.671, 0.216)
)

stock_identifiers <- 1:number_of_stocks |> 
  map_df(
    function(x) {
      tibble(
        permno = x,
        gvkey = as.character(x + 10000),
        exchange = sample(exchanges$exchange, 1, 
                          prob = exchanges$prob),
        industry = sample(industries$industry, 1, 
                          prob = industries$prob)
      ) |> 
        mutate(
          exchcd = case_when(
            exchange == "NYSE" ~ sample(c(1, 31), n()),
            exchange == "AMEX" ~ sample(c(2, 32), n()),
            exchange == "NASDAQ" ~ sample(c(3, 33), n())
          ),
          siccd = case_when(
            industry == "Agriculture" ~ sample(1:999, n()),
            industry == "Mining" ~ sample(1000:1499, n()),
            industry == "Construction" ~ sample(1500:1799, n()),
            industry == "Manufacturing" ~ sample(1800:3999, n()),
            industry == "Transportation" ~ sample(4000:4899, n()),
            industry == "Utilities" ~ sample(4900:4999, n()),
            industry == "Wholesale" ~ sample(5000:5199, n()),
            industry == "Retail" ~ sample(5200:5999, n()),
            industry == "Finance" ~ sample(6000:6799, n()),
            industry == "Services" ~ sample(7000:8999, n()),
            industry == "Public" ~ sample(9000:9999, n())
          )
        )
    }
  )
```

Next, we construct three panels of stock data with varying frequencies: yearly, monthly, and daily. We begin by creating the `stock_panel_yearly` panel. To achieve this, we combine the `stock_identifiers` table with a new table containing the variable `year` from `time_series_years`. The `expand_grid()` function ensures that we get all possible combinations of the two tables. After combining, we select only the `gvkey` and `year` columns for our final yearly panel.

Next, we construct the `stock_panel_monthly` panel. Similar to the yearly panel, we use the `expand_grid()` function to combine `stock_identifiers` with a new table that has the `month` variable from `time_series_months`. After merging, we select the columns `permno`, `gvkey`, `month`, `siccd`, `industry`, `exchcd`, and `exchange` to form our monthly panel.

Lastly, we create the `stock_panel_daily` panel. We combine `stock_identifiers` with a table containing the `date` variable from `time_series_days`. After merging, we retain only the `permno` and `date` columns for our daily panel.

```{r}
stock_panel_yearly <- expand_grid(
  stock_identifiers, 
  tibble(year = time_series_years)
) |> 
  select(gvkey, year)

stock_panel_monthly <- expand_grid(
  stock_identifiers, 
  tibble(month = time_series_months)
) |> 
  select(permno, gvkey, month, siccd, industry, exchcd, exchange)

stock_panel_daily <- expand_grid(
  stock_identifiers, 
  tibble(date = time_series_days)
)|> 
  select(permno, date)
```

### Dummy `beta` table

We then proceed to create dummy beta values for our `stock_panel_monthly` table. We generate monthly beta values `beta_monthly` using the `rnorm()` function with a mean and standard deviation of 1. For daily beta values `beta_daily`, we take the dummy monthly beta and add a small random noise to it. This noise is generated again using the `rnorm()` function, but this time we divide the random values by 100 to ensure they are small deviations from the monthly beta.

```{r}
beta_dummy <- stock_panel_monthly |> 
  mutate(
    beta_monthly = rnorm(n(), mean = 1, sd = 1),
    beta_daily = beta_monthly + rnorm(n()) / 100
  )

dbWriteTable(
  tidy_finance,
  "beta", 
  beta_dummy, 
  overwrite = TRUE
)
```

### Dummy `compustat` table

To create dummy firm characteristics, we take all columns from the `compustat` table and create random numbers between 0 and 1. For simplicity, we set the `datadate` for each firm-year observation to the last day of the year, although it is empirically not the case. We then use the `!!!` operator to unlist and execute a list of commands. This trick actually helps us to avoid typing the same function for each column individually.

```{r}
relevant_columns <- c(
  "seq", "ceq", "at", "lt", "txditc", "txdb", "itcb", 
  "pstkrv", "pstkl", "pstk", "capx", "oancf", "sale", 
  "cogs", "xint", "xsga", "be", "op", "at_lag", "inv"
)

commands <- unlist(
  map(
    relevant_columns, 
    ~rlang::exprs(!!..1 := runif(n()))
  )
)

compustat_dummy <- stock_panel_yearly |> 
  mutate(
    datadate = ymd(str_c(year, "12", "31")),
    !!!commands
  )

dbWriteTable(
  tidy_finance, 
  "compustat", 
  compustat_dummy,
  overwrite = TRUE
)
```

### Dummy `crsp_monthly` table

The `crsp_monthly` table only lacks a few more columns compared to `stock_panel_monthly`: the returns `ret` drawn from a normal distribution, the excess returns `ret_excess` with small deviations from the returns, the shares outstanding `shrout` and the last price per month `altprc` both drawn from uniform distributions, and the market capitalization `mktcap` as the product of `shrout` and `altprc`.

```{r}
crsp_monthly_dummy <- stock_panel_monthly |> 
  mutate(
    date = ceiling_date(month, "month") - 1,
    ret = pmax(rnorm(n()), -1),
    ret_excess = pmax(ret - runif(n(), 0, 0.0025), -1),
    shrout = runif(n(), 1, 50) * 1000,
    altprc = runif(n(), 0, 1000),
    mktcap = shrout * altprc
  ) |> 
  group_by(permno) |> 
  arrange(month) |> 
  mutate(mktcap_lag = lag(mktcap)) |> 
  ungroup()

dbWriteTable(
  tidy_finance, 
  "crsp_monthly",
  crsp_monthly_dummy,
  overwrite = TRUE
)
```

### Dummy `crsp_daily` table

The `crsp_daily` table only contains a `month` column and the daily excess returns `ret_excess` as additional columns to `stock_panel_daily`.  

```{r}
crsp_daily_dummy <- stock_panel_daily |> 
  mutate(
    month = floor_date(date, "month"),
    ret_excess = pmax(rnorm(n()), -1)
  )

dbWriteTable(
  tidy_finance,
  "crsp_daily",
  crsp_daily_dummy, 
  overwrite = TRUE
)
```

## Create bond dummy data

Lastly, we move to the bond data that we use in our books. 

### Dummy `fisd` data

To create dummy data with the structure of Mergent FISD, we calculate the empirical probabilities of actual bonds for several variables: `maturity`, `offering_amt`, `interest_frequency`, `coupon`, and `sic_code`. We use these probabilities to sample a small cross-section of bonds with completely made up `complete_cusip`, `issue_id`, and `issuer_id`. 

```{r}
number_of_bonds <- 100

fisd_dummy <- 1:number_of_bonds |> 
  map_df(
    function(x) {
      tibble(
        complete_cusip = str_to_upper(
          str_c(
            sample(c(letters, 0:9), 12, replace = TRUE), 
            collapse = ""
          )
        ),
      )
    }
  ) |> 
  mutate(
    maturity = sample(time_series_days, n(), replace = TRUE),
    offering_amt = sample(seq(1:100) * 100000, n(), replace = TRUE),
    offering_date = maturity - sample(seq(1:25) * 365, n(),replace = TRUE),
    dated_date = offering_date - sample(-10:10, n(), replace = TRUE),
    interest_frequency = sample(c(0, 1, 2, 4, 12), n(), replace = TRUE),
    coupon = sample(seq(0, 2, by = 0.1), n(), replace = TRUE),
    last_interest_date = pmax(maturity, offering_date, dated_date),
    issue_id = row_number(),
    issuer_id = sample(1:250, n(), replace = TRUE),
    sic_code = as.character(sample(seq(1:9)*1000, n(), replace = TRUE))
  )
  
dbWriteTable(
  tidy_finance, 
  "fisd", 
  fisd_dummy, 
  overwrite = TRUE
)
```

### Dummy `trace_enhanced` data

Finally, we create a dummy bond transaction data for the fictional CUSIPs of the dummy `fisd` data. We take the date range that we also analyze in the book and ensure that we have at least five transactions per day to fulfill a filtering step in the book. 

```{r}
start_date <- as.Date("2014-01-01")
end_date <- as.Date("2016-11-30")

bonds_panel <- expand_grid(
  fisd_dummy |> 
    select(cusip_id = complete_cusip),
  tibble(
    trd_exctn_dt = seq(start_date, end_date, "1 day")
  )
)

trace_enhanced_dummy <- bind_rows(
  bonds_panel, bonds_panel, 
  bonds_panel, bonds_panel, 
  bonds_panel) |> 
  mutate(
    trd_exctn_tm = str_c(
      sample(0:24, n(), replace = TRUE), ":", 
      sample(0:60, n(), replace = TRUE), ":", 
      sample(0:60, n(), replace = TRUE)
    ),
    rptd_pr = runif(n(), 10, 200),
    entrd_vol_qt = sample(1:20, n(), replace = TRUE) * 1000,
    yld_pt = runif(n(), -10, 10),
    rpt_side_cd = sample(c("B", "S"), n(), replace = TRUE),
    cntra_mp_id = sample(c("C", "D"), n(), replace = TRUE)
  ) 
  
dbWriteTable(
  tidy_finance, 
  "trace_enhanced", 
  trace_enhanced_dummy, 
  overwrite = TRUE
)
```

As stated in the introduction, the data does *not* contain any samples of the original data. We merely generate random numbers for all columns of the tables that we use throughout the books. You can find the database with the dummy data [here](https://github.com/tidy-finance/website/tree/main/blog/tidy-finance-dummy-data/data).
