As part of the pull request [Commit 91d3077](https://github.com/tidy-finance/website/pull/42/commits/91d3077ee75a3ab71db684001d0562a53031c73c), we now select excess returns instead of net returns in the Chapter [Fama-MacBeth Regressions](fama-macbeth-regressions.qmd).

Additionally, we added a small explanation to potential issues with the function for clustered sorting variables in Chapter [Univariate Portfolio Sorts](univariate-portfolio-sorts.qmd).
