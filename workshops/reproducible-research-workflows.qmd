We offer a comprehensive, **three-day workshop** tailored specifically for doctoral students. Reproducible research workflows are essential for ensuring the credibility and longevity of scholarly endeavors. Moreover, all finance top journals adopted some form of code and data sharing policy in recent years. 

This workshop equips participants with the tools and techniques to foster **reproducibility** and **effective communication** in their research practices, irrespective of their preferred coding language. We encourage participants to bring existing research projects to the workshop, where they can reflect upon and improve their workflows with guidance from the instructor and peers.

While prior experience with programming and data analysis tools is beneficial, this workshop is designed to accommodate participants with varying proficiency levels. It provides foundational knowledge alongside advanced techniques for reproducible research that can be applied to **any programming language**.
