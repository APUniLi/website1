  <title>Construction of a Historical S&amp;P 500 Total Return Index</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ I recently wanted to simulate simple equity savings plans over long time horizons and many different starting periods. The good thing is that the S&amp;P 500 index provides a great starting point as it is easily available since 1928 via <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/">Yahoo Finance</a>. However, I wanted my savings plans to be accumulating, i.e., all cash distributions are reinvested in the savings plan. The S&amp;P index is inadequate for this situation as it is a price index that only tracks its componentsâ€™ price movements. The <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ESP500TR/">S&amp;P 500 Total Return Index</a> tracks the overall performance of the S&amp;P 500 and would be the solution to my problem, but it is only available since 1988. ]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[ Empirical finance can be tedious. Many standard tasks, such as cleaning data or forming factor portfolios, require a lot of effort. The code to produce even seminal results is typically opaque. Why should researchers have to reinvent the wheel over and over again? ]]></description>
