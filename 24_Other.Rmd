# Other data providers

In the previous chapters, we introduced many ways to get financial data that researchers regularly use. We showed how to load data into R from Yahoo!Finance and commonly used file types, such as comma-separated files, Excel files, etc. Then, we introduced remotely connecting to WRDS and downloading data from there. However, this is only a subset of the vast amounts of data you could use.

In this chapter, we cover alternative data providers and show how to acquire data from them in R. We aim to demonstrate how easy it is to connect to various providers and show more of R's vast abilities. Nevertheless, we can only cover the tip of the iceberg. The number of packages that provide access to data is too large to survey here exhaustively. Yet we try to cover many useful and frequently used options in finance.
