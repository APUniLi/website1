Code chunks and text might change over the next couple of months. We are always looking for feedback via [contact\\@tidy-finance.org](mailto:contact@tidy-finance.org). Meanwhile, you can find the complete R version [here](../r/index.qmd).\n:::\n\nThis chapter shows how to connect to [Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS)](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/), a popular provider of financial and economic data for research applications. We use this connection to download the most commonly used data for stock and firm characteristics, CRSP and Compustat. Unfortunately, this data is not freely available, but most students and researchers typically have access to WRDS through their university libraries. Assuming that you have access to WRDS, we show you how to prepare and merge the databases and store them in the `sqlite`-database introduced in the previous chapter. We conclude this chapter by providing some tips for working with the WRDS database.\\index{WRDS}\n\nFirst, we load the Python packages that we use throughout this chapter. Later on, we load more packages in the sections where we need them. \n\n::: {#13f06585 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport sqlite3\n\nfrom plotnine import *\nfrom mizani.formatters import comma_format, percent_format\nfrom pandas.tseries.offsets import DateOffset\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Accessing WRDS\n\nWRDS is the most widely used source for asset and firm-specific financial data used in academic settings. WRDS is a data platform that provides data validation, flexible delivery options, and access to many different data sources. The data at WRDS is also organized in an SQL database, although they use the [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) engine. This database engine is just as easy to handle with Python as SQL. We use the `sqlalchemy` package to establish a connection to the WRDS database because it already contains a suitable driver.^[An alternative to establish a connection to WRDS is to use the (WRDS-Py)[https://pypi.org/project/wrds/] library. We chose to work with `sqlalchemy` [@sqlalchemy] to show how to access `PostgreSQLÂ´ engines  in general.]\\index{Database!PostgreSQL} \n\n::: {#27e9843f .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo establish a connection, you use the function `create_engine()` with a connection string. Note that you need to replace the `WRDS_USER` and `WRDS_PASSWORD` arguments with your own credentials. We defined environment variables for the purpose of this book because we obviously do not want (and are not allowed) to share our credentials with the rest of the world (these environment variables are stored in the `.env` file of our project directory, loaded with `load_dotenv()`, and then called with the `os.getenv()` function).\n\nAdditionally, you have to use multi-factor (i.e., two-factor) authentication since May 2023 when establishing a remote connection to WRDS. You have two choices to provide the additional identification. First, if you have Duo Push enabled for your WRDS account, you will receive a push notification on your mobile phone when trying to establish a connection with the code below. Upon accepting the notification, you can continue your work. Second, you can log in to a WRDS website that requires multi-factor authentication with your username and the same IP address. Once you have successfully identified yourself on the website, your username-IP combination will be remembered for 30 days, and you can comfortably use the remote connection below.\\index{Two-factor authentication}\\index{WRDS:Two-factor authentication}\n\n::: {#c294c00e .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport os\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nload_dotenv()\n\nconnection_string = (\n  \"postgresql+psycopg2://\" + \n  os.getenv(\"WRDS_USER\") + \":\" + \n  os.getenv(\"WRDS_PASSWORD\") +\n  \"@wrds-pgdata.wharton.upenn.edu:9737/wrds\"\n)\n\nwrds = create_engine(connection_string, pool_pre_ping=True)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe remote connection to WRDS is very useful. Yet, the database itself contains many different tables. You can check the WRDS homepage to identify the table's name you are looking for (if you go beyond our exposition).\n\n## Downloading and Preparing CRSP\n\n\\index{Data!CRSP}[The Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP)](https://crsp.org/) provides the most widely used data for US stocks. We use the `wrds` engine object that we just created to first access monthly CRSP return data. Actually, we need three tables to get the desired data: (i) the CRSP monthly security file `msf`, (ii) the identifying information `msenames`, and (iii) the delisting information `msedelist`.\n\nWe use the three remote tables to fetch the data we want to put into our local database. Just as above, the idea is that we let the WRDS database do all the work and just download the data that we actually need. We apply common filters and data selection criteria to narrow down our data of interest: (i) we keep only data in the time windows of interest, (ii) we keep only US-listed stocks as identified via share codes `shrcd` 10 and 11, and (iii) we keep only months within permno-specific start dates `namedt` and end dates `nameendt`. In addition, we add delisting codes  and returns. You can read up in the great textbook of @BaliEngleMurray2016 for an extensive discussion on the filters we apply in the code below.\\index{Permno}\n\n::: {#e67a5689 .cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ncrsp_monthly_query = (\n  \"SELECT msf.permno, msf.date, \"\n          \"date_trunc('month', msf.date)::date as month, \"\n          \"msf.ret, msf.shrout, msf.altprc, \"\n          \"msenames.exchcd, msenames.siccd, \"\n          \"msedelist.dlret, msedelist.dlstcd \"\n    \"FROM crsp.msf AS msf \"\n    \"LEFT JOIN crsp.msenames as msenames \"\n    \"ON msf.permno = msenames.permno AND \"\n       \"msenames.namedt <= msf.date AND \"\n       \"msf.date <= msenames.nameendt \"\n    \"LEFT JOIN crsp.msedelist as msedelist \"\n    \"ON msf.permno = msedelist.permno AND \"\n       \"date_trunc('month', msf.date)::date = \"\n       \"date_trunc('month', msedelist.dlstdt)::date \"\n    \"WHERE msf.date BETWEEN '01/01/1960' AND '12/31/2022' \"\n          \"AND msenames.shrcd IN (10, 11)\"\n)\n\ncrsp_monthly = (pd.read_sql_query(\n    sql=crsp_monthly_query,\n    con=wrds,\n    dtype={\"permno\": np.int64,\n           \"exchcd\": np.int64, \n           \"siccd\": np.int64},\n    parse_dates={\"date\", \"month\"})\n  .assign(shrout = lambda x: x[\"shrout\"] * 1000)\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow, we have all the relevant monthly return data in memory and proceed with preparing the data for future analyses. We perform the preparation step at the current stage since we want to avoid executing the same mutations every time we use the data in subsequent chapters. \n\nThe first additional variable we create is market capitalization (`mktcap`), which is the product of the number of outstanding shares `shrout` and the last traded price in a month `altprc`.\\index{Market capitalization} Note that in contrast to returns `ret`, these two variables are not adjusted ex-post for any corporate actions like stock splits. Moreover, the `altprc` is negative whenever the last traded price does not exist, and CRSP decides to report the mid-quote of the last available order book instead. Hence, we take the absolute value of the market cap. We also keep the market cap in millions of USD just for convenience as we do not want to print huge numbers in our figures and tables. In addition, we set zero market cap to missing as it makes conceptually little sense (i.e., the firm would be bankrupt).\\index{Stock price}\\index{Returns}\n\n::: {#bf9aeb1a .cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ncrsp_monthly = (crsp_monthly\n  .assign(\n    mktcap = lambda x: abs(x[\"shrout\"] * x[\"altprc\"] / 10**6)\n  )\n  .assign(\n    mktcap = lambda x: x[\"mktcap\"].replace(0, np.nan)\n  )\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe next variable we frequently use is the one-month *lagged* market capitalization. Lagged market capitalization is typically used to compute value-weighted portfolio returns, as we demonstrate in a later chapter. The most simple and consistent way to add a column with lagged market cap values is to add one month to each observation and then join the information to our monthly CRSP data.\\index{Weighting!Value}\n\n::: {#cc472037 .cell execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nmktcap_lag = (crsp_monthly\n  .assign(\n    month = lambda x: x[\"month\"] + DateOffset(months=1),\n    mktcap_lag = lambda x: x[\"mktcap\"]\n   )\n  .get([\"permno\", \"month\", \"mktcap_lag\"])\n)\n\ncrsp_monthly = (crsp_monthly\n  .merge(mktcap_lag, \n         how=\"left\", \n         on=[\"permno\", \"month\"])\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNext, we follow @BaliEngleMurray2016 in transforming listing exchange codes to explicit exchange names.\\index{Exchange!Exchange codes}\n\n::: {#cab6f297 .cell execution_count=8}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef assign_exchange(exchcd):\n    if exchcd in [1, 31]:\n        return \"NYSE\"\n    elif exchcd in [2, 32]:\n        return \"AMEX\"\n    elif exchcd in [3, 33]:\n        return \"NASDAQ\"\n    else:\n        return \"Other\"\n\ncrsp_monthly[\"exchange\"] = (crsp_monthly[\"exchcd\"]\n  .apply(assign_exchange)\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nSimilarly, we transform industry codes to industry descriptions following @BaliEngleMurray2016.\\index{Industry codes} Notice that there are also other categorizations of industries [e.g., @FamaFrench1997] that are commonly used.\n\n::: {#4114470c .cell execution_count=9}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef assign_industry(siccd):\n    if 1 <= siccd <= 999:\n        return \"Agriculture\"\n    elif 1000 <= siccd <= 1499:\n        return \"Mining\"\n    elif 1500 <= siccd <= 1799:\n        return \"Construction\"\n    elif 2000 <= siccd <= 3999:\n        return \"Manufacturing\"\n    elif 4000 <= siccd <= 4899:\n        return \"Transportation\"\n    elif 4900 <= siccd <= 4999:\n        return \"Utilities\"\n    elif 5000 <= siccd <= 5199:\n        return \"Wholesale\"\n    elif 5200 <= siccd <= 5999:\n        return \"Retail\"\n    elif 6000 <= siccd <= 6799:\n        return \"Finance\"\n    elif 7000 <= siccd <= 8999:\n        return \"Services\"\n    elif 9000 <= siccd <= 9999:\n        return \"Public\"\n    else:\n        return \"Missing\"\n\ncrsp_monthly[\"industry\"] = (crsp_monthly[\"siccd\"]\n  .apply(assign_industry)\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe also construct returns adjusted for delistings as described by @BaliEngleMurray2016. The delisting of a security usually results when a company ceases operations, declares bankruptcy, merges, does not meet listing requirements, or seeks to become private. The adjustment tries to reflect the returns of investors who bought the stock in the month before the delisting and held it until the delisting date. After this transformation, we can drop the delisting returns and codes.\\index{Returns!Delisting}\n\n::: {#1ce2f79c .cell execution_count=10}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nconditions_delisting = [\n    crsp_monthly[\"dlstcd\"].isna(),\n    (~crsp_monthly[\"dlstcd\"].isna()) & \n      (~crsp_monthly[\"dlret\"].isna()),\n    crsp_monthly[\"dlstcd\"].isin([500, 520, 580, 584]) | \n        ((crsp_monthly[\"dlstcd\"] >= 551) & \n          (crsp_monthly[\"dlstcd\"] <= 574)),\n    crsp_monthly[\"dlstcd\"] == 100\n]\n\nchoices_delisting = [\n    crsp_monthly[\"ret\"],\n    crsp_monthly[\"dlret\"],\n    -0.30,\n    crsp_monthly[\"ret\"]\n]\n\ncrsp_monthly = (crsp_monthly\n  .assign(\n    ret_adj = np.select(conditions_delisting, \n                        choices_delisting, default=-1)\n  )\n  .drop(columns=[\"dlret\", \"dlstcd\"])\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNext, we compute excess returns by subtracting the monthly risk-free rate provided by our Fama-French data.\\index{Returns!Excess}\\index{Risk-free rate} As we base all our analyses on the excess returns, we can drop adjusted returns and the risk-free rate from our tibble. Note that we ensure excess returns are bounded by -1 from below as a return less than -100% makes no sense conceptually. Before we can adjust the returns, we have to connect to our database and load the tibble `factors_ff_monthly`.\n\n::: {#5b0a0d4c .cell execution_count=11}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ntidy_finance = sqlite3.connect(\n  database=\"data/tidy_finance_python.sqlite\"\n)\n\nfactors_ff3_monthly = pd.read_sql_query(\n  sql=\"SELECT month, rf FROM factors_ff3_monthly\",\n  con=tidy_finance,\n  parse_dates={\"month\"}\n)\n  \ncrsp_monthly = (crsp_monthly\n  .merge(factors_ff3_monthly, \n         how=\"left\", \n         on=\"month\")\n  .assign(\n    ret_excess = lambda x: x[\"ret_adj\"] - x[\"rf\"]\n  )\n  .assign(\n    ret_excess = lambda x: x[\"ret_excess\"].clip(lower=-1)\n  )\n  .drop(columns = [\"ret_adj\", \"rf\"])\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nSince excess returns and market capitalization are crucial for all our analyses, we can safely exclude all observations with missing returns or market capitalization. \n\n::: {#ff40120d .cell execution_count=12}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ncrsp_monthly = (crsp_monthly\n  .dropna(subset=[\"ret_excess\", \"mktcap\", \"mktcap_lag\"])\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nFinally, we store the monthly CRSP file in our database. Note that we convert the dates to the convention of using 1970-01-01 as the date of day zero (as it used in the programming language R).\n\n::: {#84bcb7c8 .cell execution_count=13}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n(crsp_monthly\n  .to_sql(name=\"crsp_monthly\", \n          con=tidy_finance, \n          if_exists=\"replace\",\n          index = False)\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## First Glimpse of the CRSP Sample\n\nBefore we move on to other data sources, let us look at some descriptive statistics of the CRSP sample, which is our main source for stock returns. \n\n@fig-211 shows the monthly number of securities by listing exchange over time. NYSE has the longest history in the data, but NASDAQ lists a considerably large number of stocks. The number of stocks listed on AMEX decreased steadily over the last couple of decades. By the end of 2022, there were 2,778 stocks with a primary listing on NASDAQ, 1,358 on NYSE, 162 on AMEX, and only one belonged to the other category. \\index{Exchange!NYSE}\\index{Exchange!AMEX}\\index{Exchange!NASDAQ}\n\n::: {#cell-fig-211 .cell execution_count=14}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nsecurities_per_exchange = (crsp_monthly\n  .groupby([\"exchange\", \"date\"])\n  .size()\n  .reset_index(name=\"n\")\n)\n\nsecurities_per_exchange_figure = (\n  ggplot(securities_per_exchange, \n         aes(x=\"date\", y=\"n\", color=\"exchange\")) +\n  geom_line() + \n  labs(\n    x=\"\", y=\"\", color=\"\",\n    title=\"Monthly number of securities by listing exchange\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_datetime(\n    date_breaks=\"10 years\", date_labels=\"%Y\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels=comma_format())\n)\nsecurities_per_exchange_figure.draw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=14}\n![Number of stocks in the CRSP sample listed at each of the US exchanges.](wrds-crsp-and-compustat_files/figure-html/fig-211-output-1.png){#fig-211 fig-alt='Title: Monthly number of securities by listing exchange.

Other listing exchanges do only play a minor role.'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNext, we look at the aggregate market capitalization grouped by the respective listing exchanges in @fig-212. To ensure that we look at meaningful data which is comparable over time, we adjust the nominal values for inflation. In fact, we can use the tables that are already in our database to calculate aggregate market caps by listing exchange. All values in @fig-212 are at the end of 2022 USD to ensure intertemporal comparability. NYSE-listed stocks have by far the largest market capitalization, followed by NASDAQ-listed stocks.\\index{Data!CPI}\n\n::: {#cell-fig-212 .cell execution_count=15}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ncpi_monthly = pd.read_sql_query(\n  sql=\"SELECT * FROM cpi_monthly\",\n  con=tidy_finance,\n  parse_dates={\"month\"}\n)\n\nmarket_cap_per_exchange = (crsp_monthly\n  .merge(cpi_monthly, \n         how=\"left\", \n         on=\"month\")\n  .groupby([\"month\", \"exchange\"])\n  .apply(\n    lambda group: pd.Series({\n      \"mktcap\": (group[\"mktcap\"].sum() / group[\"cpi\"].mean())\n    })\n  )\n  .reset_index()\n)\n\nmarket_cap_per_exchange_figure = (\n  ggplot(market_cap_per_exchange, \n         aes(x=\"month\", y=\"mktcap / 1000\", \n             color=\"exchange\", linetype=\"exchange\")) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", y=\"\", color=\"\", linetype=\"\",\n    title=(\"Monthly market cap by listing exchange \" + \n           \"in billions of Dec 2022 USD\")\n  ) + \n  scale_x_datetime(\n    date_breaks=\"10 years\", date_labels=\"%Y\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels=comma_format())\n)\nmarket_cap_per_exchange_figure.draw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=15}\n![Market capitalization is measured in billion USD, adjusted for consumer price index changes such that the values on the horizontal axis reflect the buying power of billion USD in December 2022.](wrds-crsp-and-compustat_files/figure-html/fig-212-output-1.png){#fig-212 fig-alt='Title: Monthly market cap by listing exchange in billion USD as of Dec 2022.

'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Daily CRSP Data\n\nBefore we turn to accounting data, we provide a proposal for downloading daily CRSP data. While the monthly data from above typically fit into your memory and can be downloaded in a meaningful amount of time, this is usually not true for daily return data. The daily CRSP data file is substantially larger than monthly data and can exceed 20GB. This has two important implications: you cannot hold all the daily return data in your memory (hence it is not possible to copy the entire data set to your local database), and in our experience, the download usually crashes (or never stops) because it is too much data for the WRDS cloud to prepare and send to your Python session. \n\nThere is a solution to this challenge. As with many *big data* problems, you can split up the big task into several smaller tasks that are easier to handle.\\index{Big data} That is, instead of downloading data about all stocks at once, download the data in small batches of stocks consecutively. Such operations can be implemented in `for`-loops,\\index{For-loops} where we download, prepare, and store the data for a small number of stocks in each iteration. This operation might nonetheless take around 20 minutes, depending on your internet connection. To keep track of the progress, we create ad-hoc progress updates using `print()`. Notice that we also use the function `to_sql()` here with the option to append the new data to an existing table, when we process the second and all following batches. \n\n::: {#a9dd5bbc .cell execution_count=18}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfactors_ff3_daily = pd.read_sql(\n  sql=\"SELECT * FROM factors_ff3_daily\", \n  con=tidy_finance,\n  parse_dates={\"date\"}\n)\n  \npermnos = pd.read_sql(\n  \"SELECT DISTINCT permno FROM crsp_monthly\", \n  tidy_finance,\n)\n\nbatch_size = 100\nbatches = np.ceil(len(permnos) / batch_size).astype(int)\n  \nfor j in range(1, batches + 1):  \n    \n    permno_chunk = permnos[\n      ((j - 1) * batch_size):(min(j * batch_size, len(permnos)))\n    ]\n    \n    permno_str = \"('\" + \"', '\".join(permno_chunk[\"permno\"].astype(str)) + \"')\"\n  \n    crsp_daily_sub_query = (\n      \"SELECT permno, date, ret \" + \n        \"FROM crsp.dsf \" +\n        \"WHERE permno IN \" + permno_str + \" \" + \n        \"AND date BETWEEN '01/01/1960' AND '12/31/2022'\" \n    )\n    \n    crsp_daily_sub = (pd.read_sql_query(\n        sql=crsp_daily_sub_query,\n        con=wrds,\n        dtype={\"permno\": np.int64},\n        parse_dates={\"date\"}\n      )\n      .dropna()\n    )\n\n    if not crsp_daily_sub.empty:\n        crsp_daily_sub = (crsp_daily_sub\n          .assign(\n            month = lambda x: x[\"date\"].dt.to_period(\"M\").dt.to_timestamp()\n          )\n          .merge(factors_ff3_daily[[\"date\", \"rf\"]], \n                 on=\"date\", how=\"left\")\n          .assign(\n            ret_excess = lambda x: \n              ((x[\"ret\"] - x[\"rf\"]).clip(lower=-1))\n          )\n          .get([\"permno\", \"date\", \"month\", \"ret_excess\"])\n        )\n          \n        if j == 1:\n            crsp_daily_sub.to_sql(\n              name=\"crsp_daily\", \n              con=tidy_finance, \n              if_exists=\"replace\", \n              index=False\n            )\n        else:\n            crsp_daily_sub.to_sql(\n              name=\"crsp_daily\", \n              con=tidy_finance,\n              if_exists=\"append\", \n              index=False\n            )\n            \n        print(f\"Chunk {j} out of {batches} done ({(j / batches) * 100:.2f}%)\\n\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nEventually, we end up with more than 71 million rows of daily return data. Note that we only store the identifying information that we actually need, namely `permno`, `date`, and `month` alongside the excess returns. We thus ensure that our local database contains only the data we actually use and that we can load the full daily data into our memory later. \n\nTo the best of our knowledge, the daily CRSP data does not require any adjustments like the monthly data. The adjustment of the monthly data comes from the fact that CRSP aggregates daily data into monthly observations and has to decide which prices and returns to record if a stock gets delisted. In the daily data, there is simply no price or return after delisting, so there is also no aggregation problem.\n\n## Preparing Compustat data\n\nFirm accounting data are an important source of information that we use in portfolio analyses in subsequent chapters. The commonly used source for firm financial information is Compustat provided by [S&P Global Market Intelligence,](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/) which is a global data vendor that provides financial, statistical, and market information on active and inactive companies throughout the world.\\index{Data!Compustat} For US and Canadian companies, annual history is available back to 1950 and quarterly as well as monthly histories date back to 1962.\n\nTo access Compustat data, we can again tap WRDS, which hosts the `funda` table that contains annual firm-level information on North American companies. We follow the typical filter conventions and pull only data that we actually need: (i) we get only records in industrial data format, (ii) in the standard format (i.e., consolidated information in standard presentation), and (iii) only data in the desired time window.\\index{Gvkey}\n\n::: {#cfa01652 .cell execution_count=19}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ncompustat_query = (\n  \"SELECT gvkey, datadate, seq, ceq, at, lt, txditc, txdb, \"\n         \"itcb,  pstkrv, pstkl, pstk, capx, oancf, sale, \"\n         \"cogs, xint, xsga \"\n    \"FROM comp.funda \"\n    \"WHERE indfmt = 'INDL' \"\n          \"AND datafmt = 'STD' \"\n          \"AND consol = 'C' \"\n          \"AND datadate BETWEEN '01/01/1960' AND '12/31/2022'\"\n)\n\ncompustat = (pd.read_sql_query(\n    sql=compustat_query,\n    con=wrds,\n    dtype={\"gvkey\": np.int64},\n    parse_dates={\"datadate\"})\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNext, we calculate the book value of preferred stock and equity `be` and the operating profitability `op` inspired by the [variable definitions in Ken French's data library.](https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/Data_Library/variable_definitions.html) Note that we set negative or zero equity to missing which is a common practice when working with book-to-market ratios [see @Fama1992 for details].\\index{Book equity}\\index{Preferred stock}\\index{Operating profitability}\n\n::: {#15bb14ed .cell execution_count=20}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ncompustat = (compustat\n  .assign(\n    be = lambda x: \n      (x[\"seq\"].combine_first(x[\"ceq\"] + x[\"pstk\"])\n        .combine_first(x[\"at\"] - x[\"lt\"]) +\n        x[\"txditc\"].combine_first(x[\"txdb\"] + \n        x[\"itcb\"]).fillna(0) -\n        x[\"pstkrv\"].combine_first(x[\"pstkl\"])\n        .combine_first(x[\"pstk\"]).fillna(0))\n  )\n  .assign(\n    be = lambda x: \n      x[\"be\"].apply(lambda y: np.nan if y <= 0 else y)\n  )\n  .assign(\n    op = lambda x: \n      ((x[\"sale\"] - x[\"cogs\"].fillna(0) - \n        x[\"xsga\"].fillna(0) - x[\"xint\"].fillna(0)) / x[\"be\"])\n  )\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe keep only the last available information for each firm-year group. Note that `datadate` defines the time the corresponding financial data refers to (e.g., annual report as of December 31, 2022). Therefore, `datadate` is not the date when data was made available to the public. Check out the exercises for more insights into the peculiarities of `datadate`.\n\n::: {#34ae76e5 .cell execution_count=21}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ncompustat = (compustat\n  .assign(\n    year = lambda x: pd.DatetimeIndex(x[\"datadate\"]).year\n  )\n  .sort_values(\"datadate\")\n  .groupby([\"gvkey\", \"year\"], as_index=False)\n  .tail(1)\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe also compute the investment ratio `inv` according to Ken French's variable definitions as the change in total assets from one fiscal year to another. Note that we again use the approach using joins as introduced with the CRSP data above to construct lagged assets.\\index{Investment ratio}\n\n::: {#9e844bb8 .cell execution_count=22}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ncompustat_lag = (compustat\n  .get([\"gvkey\", \"year\", \"at\"])\n  .assign(year=lambda x: x[\"year\"] + 1)\n  .rename(columns={\"at\": \"at_lag\"})\n)\n\ncompustat = (compustat\n  .merge(compustat_lag, how=\"left\", on=[\"gvkey\", \"year\"])\n  .assign(\n    inv = lambda x: x[\"at\"] / x[\"at_lag\"] - 1\n  )\n  .assign(\n    inv = lambda x: \n      np.where(x[\"at_lag\"] <= 0, np.nan, x[\"inv\"])\n  )\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWith the last step, we are already done preparing the firm fundamentals. Thus, we can store them in our local database. \n\n::: {#5d400e92 .cell execution_count=23}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n(compustat\n  .to_sql(name=\"compustat\", \n          con=tidy_finance, \n          if_exists=\"replace\",\n          index = False)\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Merging CRSP with Compustat\n\nUnfortunately, CRSP and Compustat use different keys to identify stocks and firms. CRSP uses `permno` for stocks, while Compustat uses `gvkey` to identify firms. Fortunately, a curated matching table on WRDS allows us to merge CRSP and Compustat, so we create a connection to the *CRSP-Compustat Merged* table (provided by CRSP).\\index{Data!Crsp-Compustat Merged}\\index{Permno}\\index{Gvkey}\\index{Data!Linking table} The linking table contains links between CRSP and Compustat identifiers from various approaches. However, we need to make sure that we keep only relevant and correct links, again following the description outlined in @BaliEngleMurray2016. Note also that currently active links have no end date, so we just enter the current date via the SQL verb `CURRENT_DATE`.\n\n::: {#9c961e0e .cell execution_count=24}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nccmxpf_linktable_query = (\n  \"SELECT lpermno AS permno, gvkey, linkdt, \"\n         \"COALESCE(linkenddt, CURRENT_DATE) AS linkenddt \"\n    \"FROM crsp.ccmxpf_linktable \"\n    \"WHERE linktype IN ('LU', 'LC') \"\n          \"AND linkprim IN ('P', 'C') \"\n          \"AND usedflag = 1\"\n)\n\nccmxpf_linktable = (pd.read_sql_query(\n    sql=ccmxpf_linktable_query,\n    con=wrds,\n    dtype={\"permno\": np.int64, \"gvkey\": np.int64},\n    parse_dates={\"linkdt\", \"linkenddt\"})\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe use these links to create a new table with a mapping between stock identifier, firm identifier, and month. We then add these links to the Compustat `gvkey` to our monthly stock data. \n\n::: {#8ae213c6 .cell execution_count=25}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nccm_links = (crsp_monthly\n  .merge(ccmxpf_linktable, how=\"inner\", on=\"permno\")\n  .query((\"~gvkey.isnull() & (date >= linkdt) \" +\n           \"& (date <= linkenddt)\"))\n  .get([\"permno\", \"gvkey\", \"date\"])\n)\n\ncrsp_monthly = (crsp_monthly\n  .merge(ccm_links, how=\"left\", on=[\"permno\", \"date\"])\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nAs the last step, we update the previously prepared monthly CRSP file with the linking information in our local database.\n\n::: {#037ad474 .cell execution_count=26}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n(crsp_monthly\n  .to_sql(name=\"crsp_monthly\", \n          con=tidy_finance, \n          if_exists=\"replace\",\n          index = False)\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nBefore we close this chapter, let us look at an interesting descriptive statistic of our data. As the book value of equity plays a crucial role in many asset pricing applications, it is interesting to know for how many of our stocks this information is available. Hence, @fig-215 plots the share of securities with book equity values for each exchange. It turns out that the coverage is pretty bad for AMEX- and NYSE-listed stocks in the 60s but hovers around 80% for all periods thereafter. We can ignore the erratic coverage of securities that belong to the other category since there is only a handful of them anyway in our sample.\\index{Exchange!NYSE}\\index{Exchange!AMEX}\\index{Exchange!NASDAQ}\n\n::: {#cell-fig-215 .cell execution_count=27}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nshare_with_be = (crsp_monthly\n  .assign(\n    year = lambda x: pd.DatetimeIndex(x[\"month\"]).year\n  )\n  .sort_values(\"date\")\n  .groupby([\"permno\", \"year\"], as_index=False)\n  .tail(1)\n  .merge(compustat, how=\"left\", on=[\"gvkey\", \"year\"])\n  .groupby([\"exchange\", \"year\"])\n  .apply(\n    lambda x: pd.Series({\n      \"share\": (x[\"permno\"][~x[\"be\"].isnull()].nunique()\n                  / x[\"permno\"].nunique())\n    }))\n  .reset_index()\n)\n\nshare_with_be_figure = (\n  ggplot(share_with_be, \n         aes(x=\"year\", y=\"share\", color=\"exchange\")) + \n  geom_line() + \n  labs(x=\"\", y=\"\", color=\"\",\n       title=(\"Share of securities with book equity \" +\n              \"values by exchange\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels=percent_format()) + \n  coord_cartesian(ylim=(0, 1))\n)\nshare_with_be_figure.draw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=26}\n![End-of-year share of securities with book equity values by listing exchange.](wrds-crsp-and-compustat_files/figure-html/fig-215-output-1.png){#fig-215 fig-alt='Title: Share of securities with book equity values by exchange.

Compute `mkt_cap_lag` using `lag(mktcap)` rather than using joins as above. Filter out all the rows where the lag-based market capitalization measure is different from the one we computed above. Why are the two measures they different?\n1. Plot the average market capitalization of firms for each exchange and industry, respectively, over time. What do you find?\n1. In the `compustat` table, `datadate` refers to the date to which the fiscal year of a corresponding firm refers to. Count the number of observations in Compustat by `month` of this date variable. What do you find? What does the finding suggest about pooling observations with the same fiscal year?\n1.  Go back to the original Compustat data in `funda_db` and extract rows where the same firm has multiple rows for the same fiscal year. What is the reason for these observations?\n1. Keep the last observation of `crsp_monthly` by year and join it with the `compustat` table. Create the following plots: (i) aggregate  book equity by exchange over time and (ii) aggregate annual book equity by industry over time. Do you notice any different patterns to the corresponding plots based on market capitalization?\n1. Repeat the analysis of market capitalization for book equity, which we computed from the Compustat data. Then, use the matched sample to plot book equity against market capitalization. How are these two variables related?\n\n",
