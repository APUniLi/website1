Code chunks and text might change over the next couple of months. We are always looking for feedback via [contact\\@tidy-finance.org](mailto:contact@tidy-finance.org). Meanwhile, you can find the complete R version [here](../r/index.qmd).\n:::\n\nThe main aim of this chapter is to familiarize yourself with `pandas` and `numpy`, the main workhorses for data analysis in Python. \nWe start by downloading and visualizing stock data from Yahoo!Finance. Then, we move to a simple portfolio choice problem and construct the efficient frontier. These examples introduce you to our approach of *Tidy Finance*.\n\n## Working with Stock Market Data\n\nAt the start of each session, we load the required packages. Throughout the entire book, we always use `pandas` and `numpy` to perform a number of data manipulations. In this chapter, we also load the convenient `yfinance` package to download price data. \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport yfinance as yf\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe first download daily prices for one stock symbol, e.g., the Apple stock, *AAPL*, directly from the data provider Yahoo!Finance. To download the data, you can use the function `yf.download()`. \\index{Stock prices}\n\n::: {.cell cache='true' execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nprices = (yf.download(tickers=\"AAPL\", \n                      start=\"2000-01-01\", \n                      end=\"2022-12-31\")\n  .reset_index()\n  .assign(symbol = \"AAPL\")\n  .rename(columns = {\"Date\": \"date\", \n                     \"Open\": \"open\", \n                     \"High\": \"high\",\n                     \"Low\": \"low\",\n                     \"Close\": \"close\", \n                     \"Adj Close\": \"adjusted\", \n                     \"Volume\": \"volume\"\n                    })\n)\nprices.head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\r[*********************100%***********************]  1 of 1 completed\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=24}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>date</th>\n      <th>open</th>\n      <th>high</th>\n      <th>low</th>\n      <th>close</th>\n      <th>adjusted</th>\n      <th>volume</th>\n      <th>symbol</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>2000-01-03</td>\n      <td>0.936384</td>\n      <td>1.004464</td>\n      <td>0.907924</td>\n      <td>0.999442</td>\n      <td>0.848323</td>\n      <td>535796800</td>\n      <td>AAPL</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>2000-01-04</td>\n      <td>0.966518</td>\n      <td>0.987723</td>\n      <td>0.903460</td>\n      <td>0.915179</td>\n      <td>0.776801</td>\n      <td>512377600</td>\n      <td>AAPL</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>2000-01-05</td>\n      <td>0.926339</td>\n      <td>0.987165</td>\n      <td>0.919643</td>\n      <td>0.928571</td>\n      <td>0.788168</td>\n      <td>778321600</td>\n      <td>AAPL</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>2000-01-06</td>\n      <td>0.947545</td>\n      <td>0.955357</td>\n      <td>0.848214</td>\n      <td>0.848214</td>\n      <td>0.719961</td>\n      <td>767972800</td>\n      <td>AAPL</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>2000-01-07</td>\n      <td>0.861607</td>\n      <td>0.901786</td>\n      <td>0.852679</td>\n      <td>0.888393</td>\n      <td>0.754065</td>\n      <td>460734400</td>\n      <td>AAPL</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\\index{Data!YahooFinance} `yf.download()` downloads stock market data from Yahoo!Finance. The above code chunk returns a data frame with eight quite self-explanatory columns: `date`, the market prices at the `open`, `high`, `low`, and `close`, the `adjusted` price in USD, the daily `volume` (in the number of traded shares), and the `symbol`. The adjusted prices are corrected for anything that might affect the stock price after the market closes, e.g., stock splits and dividends. These actions affect the quoted prices but have no direct impact on the investors who hold the stock. Therefore, we often rely on adjusted prices when it comes to analyzing the returns an investor would have earned by holding the stock continuously.\\index{Stock price adjustments}\n\nNext, we use the `plotnine` package to visualize the time series of adjusted prices in @fig-100 . This package takes care of visualization tasks based on the principles of the grammar of graphics [@Wilkinson2012].\\index{Graph!Time series}\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom plotnine import *\n\nprices_figure = (\n  ggplot(prices, \n         aes(y=\"adjusted\", x=\"date\")) +\n geom_line() +\n labs(x=\"\", y=\"\",\n      title=\"Apple stock prices between beginning of 2000 and end of 2022\")\n)\nprices_figure.draw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=25}\n![Prices are in USD, adjusted for dividend payments and stock splits.](introduction-to-tidy-finance_files/figure-html/fig-100-output-1.png){#fig-100 fig-alt='Title: Apple stock prices between the beginning of 2000 and the end of 2022. The figure shows that the stock price of Apple increased dramatically from about 1 USD to around 125 USD.'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\\index{Returns} Instead of analyzing prices, we compute daily net returns defined as $r_t = p_t / p_{t-1} - 1$, where $p_t$ is the adjusted price on day $t$. In that context, the function `pct_change()` is helpful because it computes this percentage change.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nreturns = (prices\n  .sort_values(\"date\")\n  .assign(ret = lambda x: x[\"adjusted\"].pct_change())\n  .get([\"symbol\", \"date\", \"ret\"])\n)\nreturns.head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=26}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>symbol</th>\n      <th>date</th>\n      <th>ret</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>AAPL</td>\n      <td>2000-01-03</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>AAPL</td>\n      <td>2000-01-04</td>\n      <td>-0.084310</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>AAPL</td>\n      <td>2000-01-05</td>\n      <td>0.014633</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>AAPL</td>\n      <td>2000-01-06</td>\n      <td>-0.086539</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>AAPL</td>\n      <td>2000-01-07</td>\n      <td>0.047369</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe resulting data frame contains three columns, where the last contains the daily returns (`ret`). Note that the first entry naturally contains a missing value (`NaN`) because there is no previous price.\\index{Missing value} Obviously, the use of `pct_change()` would be meaningless if the time series is not ordered by ascending dates.\\index{Lag observations} The function `sort_values()` provides a convenient way to order observations in the correct way for our application. In case you want to order observations by descending dates, you can use the parameter `ascending=False`.\n\nFor the upcoming examples, we remove missing values as these would require separate treatment when computing, e.g., sample averages. In general, however, make sure you understand why `NA` values occur and carefully examine if you can simply get rid of these observations.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nreturns = returns.dropna() \n```\n:::\n\n\nNext, we visualize the distribution of daily returns in a histogram in @fig-101. \\index{Graph!Histogram} Additionally, we add a dashed line that indicates the 5 percent quantile of the daily returns to the histogram, which is a (crude) proxy for the worst return of the stock with a probability of at most 5 percent. The 5 percent quantile is closely connected to the (historical) value-at-risk, a risk measure commonly monitored by regulators. \\index{Value-at-risk} We refer to @Tsay2010 for a more thorough introduction to stylized facts of returns.\\index{Returns}\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom mizani.formatters import percent_format\n\nquantile_05 = returns[\"ret\"].quantile(0.05)\n\nreturns_figure = (\n  ggplot(returns, aes(x=\"ret\")) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=100) +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=quantile_05), \n                 linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  labs(x=\"\", y=\"\",\n       title=\"Distribution of daily Apple stock returns\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels=percent_format())\n)\nreturns_figure.draw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=28}\n![The dotted vertical line indicates the historical 5 percent quantile.](introduction-to-tidy-finance_files/figure-html/fig-101-output-1.png){#fig-101 fig-alt='Title: Distribution of daily Apple stock returns in percent. The figure shows a histogram of daily returns. The range indicates a few large negative values, while the remaining returns are distributed around 0. The vertical line indicates that the historical 5 percent quantile of daily returns was around negative 3 percent.'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere, `bins = 100` determines the number of bins used in the illustration and hence implicitly the width of the bins. Before proceeding, make sure you understand how to use the geom `geom_vline()` to add a dashed line that indicates the 5 percent quantile of the daily returns. A typical task before proceeding with *any* data is to compute summary statistics for the main variables of interest.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=8}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nreturns[\"ret\"].describe()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=29}\n```\ncount    5786.000000\nmean        0.001198\nstd         0.025124\nmin        -0.518692\n25%        -0.010370\n50%         0.000869\n75%         0.013140\nmax         0.139050\nName: ret, dtype: float64\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe see that the maximum *daily* return was `python round(returns[\"ret\"].max() * 100, 3)` percent. Perhaps not surprisingly, the average daily return is close to but slightly above 0. In line with the illustration above, the large losses on the day with the minimum returns indicate a strong asymmetry in the distribution of returns.\\\nYou can also compute these summary statistics for each year individually by imposing `.groupby(returns[\"date\"].dt.year)`, where the call `.dt.year` returns the year of a date variable. More specifically, the few lines of code below compute the summary statistics from above for individual groups of data defined by year. The summary statistics, therefore, allow an eyeball analysis of the time-series dynamics of the return distribution.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=9}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nreturns[\"ret\"].groupby(returns[\"date\"].dt.year).describe()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=30}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody

code from before such that all the computations can handle an arbitrary vector of stock symbols (e.g., all constituents of an index). Following tidy principles, it is quite easy to download the data, plot the price time series, and tabulate the summary statistics for an arbitrary number of assets.\n\nThis is where the magic starts: tidy data makes it extremely easy to generalize the computations from before to as many assets as you like. The following code takes any vector of symbols, e.g., `symbol = [\"AAPL\", \"MMM\", \"BA\"]`, and automates the download as well as the plot of the price time series. In the end, we create the table of summary statistics for an arbitrary number of assets. We perform the analysis with data from all current constituents of the [Dow Jones Industrial Average index.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average) \\index{Data!Dow Jones Index}\n\nWe first download a table with DOW Jones constituents from an external website.  \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=10}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nurl = (\"https://www.ssga.com/us/en/institutional/etfs/library-content/\"\n       \"products/fund-data/etfs/us/holdings-daily-us-en-dia.xlsx\")\n\nsymbols = (pd.read_excel(url, skiprows=4, nrows=30)\n  .get(\"Ticker\")\n  .tolist()\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNext, we can use `yf.download()` to download prices for all stock symbols in the above list. \n\n::: {.cell cache='true' execution_count=11}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nindex_prices = (yf.download(tickers=symbols, \n                            start=\"2000-01-01\",\n                            end=\"2022-12-31\",\n                            progress=False)\n  .melt(ignore_index=False, \n        var_name=[\"variable\", \"symbol\"])\n  .reset_index()\n  .pivot(index=[\"Date\", \"symbol\"], \n         columns=\"variable\", \n         values=\"value\")\n  .reset_index()\n  .rename(columns = {\"Date\": \"date\", \n                     \"Open\": \"open\", \n                     \"High\": \"high\", \n                     \"Low\": \"low\",\n                     \"Close\": \"close\", \n                     \"Adj Close\": \"adjusted\", \n                     \"Volume\": \"volume\"\n                    })\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe resulting data frame contains `python len(index_prices)` daily observations for `python len(index_prices[\"symbol\"].unique())` different stock symbols. @fig-103 illustrates the time series of downloaded *adjusted* prices for each of the constituents of the Dow Jones index. Make sure you understand every single line of code! What are the arguments of `aes()`? Which alternative `geoms` could you use to visualize the time series? Hint: if you do not know the answers try to change the code to see what difference your intervention causes.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=12}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nindex_prices_figure = (\n  ggplot(index_prices, \n         aes(y=\"adjusted\", x=\"date\", color=\"symbol\")) +\n geom_line() +\n labs(x=\"\", y=\"\", color=\"\",\n      title=\"Stock prices of DOW index constituents\") +\n theme(legend_position=\"none\")\n )\nindex_prices_figure.draw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=33}\n![Prices in USD, adjusted for dividend payments and stock splits.](introduction-to-tidy-finance_files/figure-html/fig-103-output-1.png){#fig-103 fig-alt='Title: Stock prices of DOW index constituents. The figure shows many time series with daily prices. The general trend seems positive for most stocks in the DOW index.'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDo you notice the small differences relative to the code we used before? `yf.download(symbols)` returns a data frame for several symbols as well. All we need to do to illustrate all symbols simultaneously is to include `color = symbol` in the `ggplot` aesthetics. In this way, we generate a separate line for each symbol. Of course, there are simply too many lines on this graph to identify the individual stocks properly, but it illustrates the point well.\n\nThe same holds for stock returns. Before computing the returns, we use `groupby(\"symbol\")` such that the `assign()` command is performed for each symbol individually. The same logic also applies to the computation of summary statistics: `groupby(\"symbol\")` is the key to aggregating the time series into symbol-specific variables of interest.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=13}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nall_returns = (index_prices\n  .assign(ret = lambda x: x.groupby(\"symbol\")[\"adjusted\"].pct_change())\n  .get([\"symbol\", \"date\", \"ret\"])\n  .dropna(subset=\"ret\")\n)\n\nall_returns.groupby(\"symbol\")[\"ret\"].describe()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=34}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe

sense. For instance, suppose you are interested in answering the question: Are days with high aggregate trading volume likely followed by days with high aggregate trading volume? To provide some initial analysis on this question, we take the downloaded data and compute aggregate daily trading volume for all Dow Jones constituents in USD. Recall that the column `volume` is denoted in the number of traded shares.\\index{Trading volume} Thus, we multiply the trading volume with the daily adjusted closing price to get a proxy for the aggregate trading volume in USD. Scaling by `1e9` (Python can handle scientific notation) denotes daily trading volume in billion USD.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=14}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ntrading_volume = (index_prices\n  .assign(trading_volume = lambda x: (x[\"volume\"] * x[\"adjusted\"]) / 1e9)\n  .groupby(\"date\")[\"trading_volume\"]\n  .sum()\n  .reset_index()\n  .assign(trading_volume_lag = lambda x: x[\"trading_volume\"].shift())\n)\n\ntrading_volume_figure = (\n  ggplot(trading_volume, \n          aes(x=\"date\", y=\"trading_volume\")) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(x=\"\", y=\"\",\n       title=\"Aggregate daily trading volume of DOW index constituents in billion USD\")\n)\ntrading_volume_figure.draw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=35}\n![Total daily trading volume in billion USD.](introduction-to-tidy-finance_files/figure-html/fig-104-output-1.png){#fig-104 fig-alt='Title: Aggregate daily trading volume.

In particular, since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, markets have processed substantial trading volumes, as analyzed, for instance, by @Goldstein2021.\\index{Covid 19} One way to illustrate the persistence of trading volume would be to plot volume on day $t$ against volume on day $t-1$ as in the example below. In @fig-105, we add a dotted 45°-line to indicate a hypothetical one-to-one relation by `geom_abline()`, addressing potential differences in the axes' scales.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=15}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ntrading_volume_figure = (\n  ggplot(trading_volume, \n         aes(x=\"trading_volume_lag\", y=\"trading_volume\")) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_abline(aes(intercept=0, slope=1), linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  labs(x=\"Previous day aggregate trading volume\",\n       y=\"Aggregate trading volume\",\n       title=\"Persistence in daily trading volume of DOW constituents in billion USD\")\n)\ntrading_volume_figure.draw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=36}\n![Total daily trading volume in billion USD.](introduction-to-tidy-finance_files/figure-html/fig-105-output-1.png){#fig-105 fig-alt='Title: Persistence in daily trading volume of DOW index constituents.

Now, we move to a typical question in Finance: how to allocate wealth across different assets optimally.\\index{Portfolio choice} The standard framework for optimal portfolio selection considers investors that prefer higher future returns but dislike future return volatility (defined as the square root of the return variance): the *mean-variance investor* [@Markowitz1952].\\index{Markowitz optimization}\n\n\\index{Efficient frontier} An essential tool to evaluate portfolios in the mean-variance context is the *efficient frontier*, the set of portfolios which satisfies the condition that no other portfolio exists with a higher expected return but with the same volatility (the square root of the variance, i.e., the risk), see, e.g., @Merton1972.\\index{Return volatility} We compute and visualize the efficient frontier for several stocks. First, we extract each asset's *monthly* returns. In order to keep things simple, we work with a balanced panel and exclude DOW constituents for which we do not observe a price on every single trading day since the year 2000.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=16}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nprices = (index_prices\n  .groupby(\"symbol\")\n  .apply(lambda x: x.assign(counts = x[\"adjusted\"].dropna().count()))\n  .reset_index(drop=True)\n  .query(\"counts == counts.max()\")\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNext, we transform the returns from a tidy data frame into a $(T \\times N)$ matrix with one column for each of the $N$ symbols and one row for each of the $T$ trading days to compute the sample average return vector $$\\hat\\mu = \\frac{1}{T}\\sum\\limits_{t=1}^T r_t$$ where $r_t$ is the $N$ vector of returns on date $t$ and the sample covariance matrix $$\\hat\\Sigma = \\frac{1}{T-1}\\sum\\limits_{t=1}^T (r_t - \\hat\\mu)(r_t - \\hat\\mu)'.$$ We achieve this by using `pivot()` with the new column names from the column `symbol` and setting the values to `adjusted`. We compute the vector of sample average returns and the sample variance-covariance matrix, which we consider as proxies for the parameters of the distribution of future stock returns. Thus, for simplicity, we refer to $\\Sigma$ and $\\mu$ instead of explicitly highlighting that the sample moments are estimates. \\index{Covariance} In later chapters, we discuss the issues that arise once we take estimation uncertainty into account.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=17}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nreturns_matrix = (prices\n  .pivot(columns=\"symbol\", \n         values=\"adjusted\", \n         index=\"date\")\n  .resample(\"m\")\n  .last()\n  .pct_change()\n  .dropna()\n)\nmu = np.array(returns_matrix.mean()).T\nsigma = np.array(returns_matrix.cov())\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen, we compute the minimum variance portfolio weights $\\omega_\\text{mvp}$ as well as the expected portfolio return $\\omega_\\text{mvp}'\\mu$ and volatility $\\sqrt{\\omega_\\text{mvp}'\\Sigma\\omega_\\text{mvp}}$ of this portfolio. \\index{Minimum variance portfolio} Recall that the minimum variance portfolio is the vector of portfolio weights that are the solution to $$\\omega_\\text{mvp} = \\arg\\min \\omega'\\Sigma \\omega \\text{ s.t. } \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^N\\omega_i = 1.$$ The constraint that weights sum up to one simply implies that all funds are distributed across the available asset universe, i.e., there is no possibility to retain cash. It is easy to show analytically that $\\omega_\\text{mvp} = \\frac{\\Sigma^{-1}\\iota}{\\iota'\\Sigma^{-1}\\iota}$, where $\\iota$ is a vector of ones and $\\Sigma^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\\Sigma$.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=18}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nN = returns_matrix.shape[1]\niota = np.ones(N)\nsigma_inv = np.linalg.inv(sigma) \n\nmvp_weights = sigma_inv @ iota\nmvp_weights /= mvp_weights.sum()\nmvp_return = (mu.T @ mvp_weights)\nmvp_volatility = np.sqrt(mvp_weights.T @ sigma @ mvp_weights)\nmvp_moments = pd.DataFrame([mvp_return, mvp_volatility],\n                          index=[\"average_ret\", \"volatility\"]).T\nmvp_moments\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=39}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>average_ret</th>\n      <th>volatility</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>0.007917</td>\n      <td>0.032072</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe command `np.linalg.inv()` returns the solution of a system of equations $Ax = b$. If `b` is not provided, as in the example above, it defaults to the identity matrix such that `np.linalg.inv(sigma)` delivers $\\Sigma^{-1}$ (if a unique solution exists).\\\nNote that the *monthly* volatility of the minimum variance portfolio is of the same order of magnitude as the *daily* standard deviation of the individual components. Thus, the diversification benefits in terms of risk reduction are tremendous!\\index{Diversification}\n\nNext, we set out to find the weights for a portfolio that achieves, as an example, three times the expected return of the minimum variance portfolio. However, mean-variance investors are not interested in any portfolio that achieves the required return but rather in the efficient portfolio, i.e., the portfolio with the lowest standard deviation. If you wonder where the solution $\\omega_\\text{eff}$ comes from: \\index{Efficient portfolio} The efficient portfolio is chosen by an investor who aims to achieve minimum variance *given a minimum acceptable expected return* $\\bar{\\mu}$. Hence, their objective function is to choose $\\omega_\\text{eff}$ as the solution to $$\\omega_\\text{eff}(\\bar{\\mu}) = \\arg\\min \\omega'\\Sigma \\omega \\text{ s.t. } \\omega'\\iota = 1 \\text{ and } \\omega'\\mu \\geq \\bar{\\mu}.$$\n\nThe code below implements the analytic solution to this optimization problem for a benchmark return $\\bar\\mu$, which we set to 3 times the expected return of the minimum variance portfolio. We encourage you to verify that it is correct.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=19}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nbenchmark_multiple = 3\nmu_bar = benchmark_multiple * mvp_return\nC = iota.T @ sigma_inv @ iota\nD = iota.T @ sigma_inv @ mu\nE = mu.T @ sigma_inv @ mu\nlambda_tilde = 2 * (mu_bar - D / C) / (E - D ** 2 / C)\n\nefp_weights = (mvp_weights + lambda_tilde / 2 *\n               (sigma_inv @ mu - D * mvp_weights))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## The Efficient Frontier\n\n\\index{Separation theorem} The mutual fund separation theorem states that as soon as we have two efficient portfolios (such as the minimum variance portfolio $\\omega_\\text{mvp}$ and the efficient portfolio for a higher required level of expected returns $\\omega_\\text{eff}(\\bar{\\mu})$, we can characterize the entire efficient frontier by combining these two portfolios. That is, any linear combination of the two portfolio weights will again represent an efficient portfolio. \\index{Efficient frontier} The code below implements the construction of the *efficient frontier*, which characterizes the highest expected return achievable at each level of risk. To understand the code better, make sure to familiarize yourself with the inner workings of the `for` loop.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=20}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nlength_year = 12\na = np.arange(-0.4, 2.0, 0.01)\nres = pd.DataFrame(columns=[\"mu\", \"sd\"], index=a).astype(float)\n\nfor i in a:\n    w = (1 - i) * mvp_weights + i * efp_weights\n    res.loc[i, \"mu\"] = (w.T @ mu) * length_year\n    res.loc[i, \"sd\"] = np.sqrt(w.T @ sigma @ w) * np.sqrt(length_year)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe code above proceeds in two steps: First, we compute a vector of combination weights $a$ and then we evaluate the resulting linear combination with $a\\in\\mathbb{R}$:\\\n$$\\omega^* = a\\omega_\\text{eff}(\\bar\\mu) + (1-a)\\omega_\\text{mvp} = \\omega_\\text{mvp} + \\frac{\\lambda^*}{2}\\left(\\Sigma^{-1}\\mu -\\frac{D}{C}\\Sigma^{-1}\\iota \\right)$$ with $\\lambda^* = 2\\frac{a\\bar\\mu + (1-a)\\tilde\\mu - D/C}{E-D^2/C}$ where $C = \\iota'\\Sigma^{-1}\\iota$, $D=\\iota'\\Sigma^{-1}\\mu$, and $E=\\mu'\\Sigma^{-1}\\mu$. Finally, it is simple to visualize the efficient frontier alongside the two efficient portfolios within one powerful figure using `ggplot` (see @fig-106). We also add the individual stocks in the same call. We compute annualized returns based on the simple assumption that monthly returns are independent and identically distributed. Thus, the average annualized return is just 12 times the expected monthly return.\\index{Graph!Efficient frontier}\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=21}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nmvp_return = (mu.T @ mvp_weights) * length_year\nmvp_volatility = np.sqrt(mvp_weights.T @ sigma @ mvp_weights) * np.sqrt(length_year)\nefp_return = mu_bar * length_year\nefp_volatility = np.sqrt(efp_weights.T @ sigma @ efp_weights) * np.sqrt(length_year)\n\nres_figure = (\n  ggplot(res, aes(x=\"sd\", y=\"mu\")) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_point(\n    pd.DataFrame({\"mu\": [mvp_return, efp_return],\n                  \"sd\": [mvp_volatility, efp_volatility]}),\n    size=4\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    pd.DataFrame({\"mu\": mu * length_year,\n                  \"sd\": np.sqrt(np.diag(sigma)) * np.sqrt(length_year)})\n  ) +\n  labs(x=\"Annualized standard deviation\",\n       y=\"Annualized expected return\",\n       title=\"Efficient frontier for DOW index constituents\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels=percent_format()) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels=percent_format())\n)\nres_figure.draw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=42}\n![The big dots indicate the location of the minimum variance and the efficient portfolio that delivers 3 times the expected return of the minimum variance portfolio, respectively.

Compare the performance relative to the individual assets (the dots) - it should become clear that diversifying yields massive performance gains (at least as long as we take the parameters $\\Sigma$ and $\\mu$ as given).\n\n## Exercises\n\n1.  Download daily prices for another stock market symbols of your choice from Yahoo!Finance with `yf.download()` from the `yfinance` package. Plot two time series of the symbol's un-adjusted and adjusted closing prices. Explain the differences.\n2.  Compute daily net returns for the asset and visualize the distribution of daily returns in a histogram. Also, use `geom_vline()` to add a dashed line that indicates the 5 percent quantile of the daily returns within the histogram. Compute summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum) for the daily returns\n3.  Take your code from before and generalize it such that you can perform all the computations for an arbitrary vector of symbols (e.g., `symbol <- [\"AAPL\", \"MMM\", \"BA\"]`). Automate the download, the plot of the price time series, and create a table of return summary statistics for this arbitrary number of assets.\n4.  Consider the research question: Are days with high aggregate trading volume often also days with large absolute price changes? Find an appropriate visualization to analyze the question.\n5.  Compute monthly returns from the downloaded stock market prices. Compute the vector of historical average returns and the sample variance-covariance matrix. Compute the minimum variance portfolio weights and the portfolio volatility and average returns. Visualize the mean-variance efficient frontier. Choose one of your assets and identify the portfolio which yields the same historical volatility but achieves the highest possible average return.\n6.  In the portfolio choice analysis, we restricted our sample to all assets trading every day since 2000. How is such a decision a problem when you want to infer future expected portfolio performance from the results?\n7.  The efficient frontier characterizes the portfolios with the highest expected return for different levels of risk, i.e., standard deviation. Identify the portfolio with the highest expected return per standard deviation. Hint: the ratio of expected return to standard deviation is an important concept in Finance.\n\n",
