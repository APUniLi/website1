Code chunks and text might change over the next couple of months. We are always looking for feedback via [contact\\@tidy-finance.org](mailto:contact@tidy-finance.org). Meanwhile, you can find the complete R version [here](../r/index.qmd).\n:::\n\nIn this chapter, we dive into portfolio sorts, one of the most widely used statistical methodologies in empirical asset pricing [e.g., @BaliEngleMurray2016]. The key application of portfolio sorts is to examine whether one or more variables can predict future excess returns. In general, the idea is to sort individual stocks into portfolios, where the stocks within each portfolio are similar with respect to a sorting variable, such as firm size. The different portfolios then represent well-diversified investments that differ in the level of the sorting variable. You can then attribute the differences in the return distribution to the impact of the sorting variable. \nWe start by introducing univariate portfolio sorts (which sort based on only one characteristic) and tackle bivariate sorting in [Value and Bivariate Sorts](value-and-bivariate-sorts.qmd). \n\nA univariate portfolio sort considers only one sorting variable $x_{t-1,i}$.\\index{Portfolio sorts!Univariate}\nHere, $i$ denotes the stock and $t-1$ indicates that the characteristic is observable by investors at time $t$.  \nThe objective is to assess the cross-sectional relation between $x_{t-1,i}$ and, typically, stock excess returns $r_{t,i}$ at time $t$ as the outcome variable. \nTo illustrate how portfolio sorts work, we use estimates for market betas from the previous chapter as our sorting variable.\n\nThe current chapter relies on the following set of packages.\n\n::: {#b073e628 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport sqlite3\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\nfrom plotnine import *\nfrom mizani.formatters import percent_format\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Data Preparation\n\nWe start with loading the required data from our `SQLite`-database introduced in [Accessing and Managing Financial Data](accessing-and-managing-financial-data.qmd) and [WRDS, CRSP, and Compustat](wrds-crsp-and-compustat.qmd). In particular, we use the monthly CRSP sample as our asset universe.\\index{Data!CRSP}\nOnce we form our portfolios, we use the Fama-French market factor returns to compute the risk-adjusted performance (i.e., alpha).\\index{Data!Fama-French factors}\n`beta` is the tibble with market betas computed in the previous chapter.\\index{Beta}\n\n::: {#d519af11 .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ntidy_finance = sqlite3.connect(\"data/tidy_finance_python.sqlite\")\n\ncrsp_monthly = (pd.read_sql_query(\n    sql=\"SELECT permno, month, ret_excess, mktcap_lag FROM crsp_monthly\",\n    con=tidy_finance,\n    dtype={\"permno\": np.int32},\n    parse_dates={\"month\"})\n  .dropna()\n)\n\nfactors_ff3_monthly = (pd.read_sql_query(\n    sql=\"SELECT month, mkt_excess FROM factors_ff3_monthly\",\n    con=tidy_finance,\n    parse_dates={\"month\"})\n  .dropna()\n)\n\nbeta = (pd.read_sql_query(\n    sql=\"SELECT permno, month, beta_monthly FROM beta\",\n    con=tidy_finance,\n    dtype={\"permno\": np.int32},\n    parse_dates={\"month\"})\n  .dropna()\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Sorting by Market Beta\n\nNext, we merge our sorting variable with the return data. We use the one-month *lagged* betas as a sorting variable to ensure that the sorts rely only on information available when we create the portfolios. \nTo lag stock beta by one month, we add one month to the current date and join the resulting information with our return data. \nThis procedure ensures that month $t$ information is available in month $t+1$. \nYou may be tempted to simply use a call such as `crsp_monthly['beta_lag'] = crsp_monthly.groupby('permno')['beta'].shift(1)` instead. \nThis procedure, however, does not work correctly if there are non-explicit missing values in the time series.\n\n::: {#419e7856 .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nbeta_lag = (beta\n  .assign(month = lambda x: x[\"month\"] + pd.DateOffset(months=1))\n  .get([\"permno\", \"month\", \"beta_monthly\"])\n  .rename(columns={\"beta_monthly\": \"beta_lag\"})\n  .dropna()\n)\n\ndata_for_sorts = (crsp_monthly\n  .merge(beta_lag, \n         how=\"inner\", \n         on=[\"permno\", \"month\"])\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe first step to conduct portfolio sorts is to calculate periodic breakpoints that you can use to group the stocks into portfolios.\\index{Breakpoints} \nFor simplicity, we start with the median lagged market beta as the single breakpoint. \nWe then compute the value-weighted returns for each of the two resulting portfolios, which means that the lagged market capitalization determines the weight in `np.average()`.  \n\n::: {#ec10e86a .cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nbeta_portfolios = (data_for_sorts\n    .groupby(\"month\", group_keys=False)\n    .apply(lambda x: x.assign(portfolio=pd.qcut(x[\"beta_lag\"], \n                                                q=[0, 0.5, 1], \n                                                labels=[\"low\", \"high\"])))\n    .groupby([\"portfolio\",\"month\"], group_keys=False)\n    .apply(lambda x: np.average(x[\"ret_excess\"], weights=x[\"mktcap_lag\"]))\n    .reset_index(name=\"ret\")\n    )\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Performance Evaluation\n\nWe can construct a long-short strategy based on the two portfolios: buy the high-beta portfolio and, at the same time, short the low-beta portfolio. Thereby, the overall position in the market is net-zero, i.e., you do not need to invest money to realize this strategy in the absence of frictions.\\index{Long-short}\n\n::: {#e8b25a2c .cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nbeta_longshort = (beta_portfolios\n  .pivot_table(index=\"month\", \n               columns=\"portfolio\", \n               values=\"ret\")\n  .reset_index()\n  .assign(long_short = lambda x: x[\"high\"] - x[\"low\"])\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe compute the average return and the corresponding standard error to test whether the long-short portfolio yields on average positive or negative excess returns. In the asset pricing literature, one typically adjusts for autocorrelation by using @Newey1987 $t$-statistics to test the null hypothesis that average portfolio excess returns are equal to zero.\\index{Standard errors!Newey-West} One necessary input for Newey-West standard errors is a chosen bandwidth based on the number of lags employed for the estimation. Researchers often default on choosing a pre-specified lag length of 6 months.\n\n::: {#f00ef139 .cell execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nmodel_fit = (sm.OLS\n  .from_formula(\"long_short ~ 1\", data=beta_longshort)\n  .fit(cov_type=\"HAC\", cov_kwds={\"maxlags\": 6})\n  .summary(slim=True)\n)\nmodel_fit_coefs = model_fit.tables[1]\nmodel_fit_coefs\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=7}\n```{=html}\n<table class=\"simpletable\">\n<tr>\n      <td></td>         <th>coef</th>     <th>std err</th>      <th>z</th>      <th>P>|z|</th>  <th>[0.025</th>    <th>0.975]</th>  \n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <th>Intercept</th> <td>   -0.0008</td> <td>    0.001</td> <td>   -0.625</td> <td> 0.532</td> <td>   -0.003</td> <td>    0.002</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe results indicate that we cannot reject the null hypothesis of average returns being equal to zero. Our portfolio strategy using the median as a breakpoint hence does not yield any abnormal returns. Is this finding surprising if you reconsider the CAPM? It certainly is. The CAPM yields that the high beta stocks should yield higher expected returns. Our portfolio sort implicitly mimics an investment strategy that finances high beta stocks by shorting low beta stocks. Therefore, one should expect that the average excess returns yield a return that is above the risk-free rate.\n\n## Functional Programming for Portfolio Sorts\n\nNow we take portfolio sorts to the next level. We want to be able to sort stocks into an arbitrary number of portfolios. For this case, functional programming is very handy: we define a function that give us flexibility concerning which variable to use for the sorting, denoted by `sorting_variable`. We use `np.quantile()` to compute breakpoints for `n_portfolios`. Then, we assign portfolios to stocks using the `pd.cut()` function. The output of the following function is a new column that contains the number of the portfolio to which a stock belongs.\\index{Functional programming} \n\nIn some applications, the variable used for the sorting might be clustered (e.g., at a lower bound of 0). Then, multiple breakpoints may be identical, leading to empty portfolios. Similarly, some portfolios might have a very small number of stocks at the beginning of the sample. Cases, where the number of portfolio constituents differs substantially due to the distribution of the characteristics, require careful consideration and, depending on the application, might require customized sorting approaches.\n\n::: {#a63e312b .cell execution_count=8}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef assign_portfolio(data, sorting_variable, n_portfolios):\n    breakpoints = np.quantile(data[sorting_variable].dropna(), \n                              np.linspace(0, 1, n_portfolios + 1), \n                              method=\"linear\")\n    assigned_portfolios = pd.cut(data[sorting_variable],\n                                 bins=breakpoints,\n                                 labels=range(1, breakpoints.size),\n                                 include_lowest=True)\n    return assigned_portfolios\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can use the above function to sort stocks into ten portfolios each month using lagged betas and compute value-weighted returns for each portfolio. Note that we transform the portfolio column to a factor variable because it provides more convenience for the figure construction below.\n\n::: {#5bb7eddd .cell execution_count=9}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nbeta_portfolios = (data_for_sorts\n  .groupby(\"month\", group_keys=False)\n  .apply(lambda x: x.assign(portfolio = assign_portfolio(x, 'beta_lag', 10)))\n  .groupby([\"portfolio\", \"month\"], group_keys=False)\n  .apply(lambda x: x.assign(ret=np.average(x[\"ret_excess\"], \n                                           weights=x[\"mktcap_lag\"])))\n  .merge(factors_ff3_monthly, \n         how=\"left\", \n         on=\"month\")\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## More Performance Evaluation\n\nIn the next step, we compute summary statistics for each beta portfolio.

According to the CAPM, returns should increase with beta across the portfolios and risk-adjusted returns should be statistically indistinguishable from zero.\n\n## The Security Market Line and Beta Portfolios\n\nThe CAPM predicts that our portfolios should lie on the security market line (SML). The slope of the SML is equal to the market risk premium and reflects the risk-return trade-off at any given time.\\index{Security market line} @fig-702 illustrates the security market line: We see that (not surprisingly) the high beta portfolio returns have a high correlation with the market returns. However, it seems like the average excess returns for high beta stocks are lower than what the security market line implies would be an \"appropriate\" compensation for the high market risk. \n\n::: {#cell-fig-702 .cell execution_count=12}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nsml_capm = (sm.OLS.from_formula(\"ret ~ 1 + beta\", data=beta_portfolios_summary)\n            .fit().params)\n\nplot_sml_capm = (\n  ggplot(beta_portfolios_summary,\n         aes(x=\"beta\", y=\"ret\", color=\"portfolio\")) +\n  geom_point() + \n  geom_abline(intercept=0,\n              slope=factors_ff3_monthly[\"mkt_excess\"].mean(),\n              linetype=\"solid\") +\n  geom_abline(intercept=sml_capm[\"Intercept\"],\n                slope=sml_capm[\"beta\"],\n                linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels=percent_format(),\n                     limits=(0, factors_ff3_monthly[\"mkt_excess\"].mean()*2)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits=(0, 2)) +\n  labs(x=\"Beta\", y=\"Excess return\", color=\"Portfolio\",\n       title=\"Average portfolio excess returns and average beta estimates\")\n)\nplot_sml_capm.draw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=12}\n![Excess returns are computed as CAPM alphas of the beta-sorted portfolios.

The results thus provide no evidence in support of the CAPM. The negative value has been documented as the so-called betting against beta factor [@Frazzini2014]. Betting against beta corresponds to a strategy that shorts high beta stocks and takes a (levered) long position in low beta stocks. If borrowing constraints prevent investors from taking positions on the SML they are instead incentivized to buy high beta stocks, which leads to a relatively higher price (and therefore lower expected returns than implied by the CAPM) for such high beta stocks. As a result, the betting-against-beta strategy earns from providing liquidity to capital constraint investors with lower risk aversion.\\index{Risk aversion}\n\n::: {#69215250 .cell execution_count=15}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nmodel_fit = (sm.OLS.from_formula(\"long_short ~ 1 + mkt_excess\", data=beta_longshort)\n  .fit(cov_type=\"HAC\", cov_kwds={\"maxlags\": 1})\n  .summary(slim=True)\n)\nmodel_fit_coefs = model_fit.tables[1]\nmodel_fit_coefs\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=15}\n```{=html}\n<table class=\"simpletable\">\n<tr>\n       <td></td>         <th>coef</th>     <th>std err</th>      <th>z</th>      <th>P>|z|</th>  <th>[0.025</th>    <th>0.975]</th>  \n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <th>Intercept</th>  <td>   -0.0047</td> <td>    0.002</td> <td>   -2.225</td> <td> 0.026</td> <td>   -0.009</td> <td>   -0.001</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n  <th>mkt_excess</th> <td>    1.1028</td> <td>    0.065</td> <td>   17.030</td> <td> 0.000</td> <td>    0.976</td> <td>    1.230</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@fig-703 shows the annual returns of the extreme beta portfolios we are mainly interested in.
