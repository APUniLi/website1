The optimal weights $\\omega_\\text{mvp}$ can be found analytically and are $\\omega_\\text{mvp} = \\frac{\\Sigma^{-1}\\iota}{\\iota'\\Sigma^{-1}\\iota}$. In terms of code, the math is equivalent to the following chunk. \\index{Minimum variance portfolio}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn_industries <- ncol(industry_returns)\n\nSigma <- cov(industry_returns)\nw_mvp <- solve(Sigma) %*% rep(1, n_industries)\nw_mvp <- as.vector(w_mvp / sum(w_mvp))\n\nmu <- colMeans(industry_returns)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNext, consider an investor who aims to achieve minimum variance *given a required expected portfolio return* $\\bar{\\mu}$ such that she chooses\n$$w_\\text{eff}({\\bar{\\mu}}) =\\arg\\min w'\\Sigma w \\text{ s.t. } w'\\iota = 1 \\text{ and } \\omega'\\mu \\geq \\bar{\\mu}.$$\nWe leave it as an exercise below to show that the portfolio choice problem can equivalently be formulated for an investor with mean-variance preferences and risk aversion factor $\\gamma$. That means the investor aims to choose portfolio weights as the solution to\n$$ w^*_\\gamma = \\arg\\max w' \\mu - \\frac{\\gamma}{2}w'\\Sigma w\\quad \\text{ s.t. } w'\\iota = 1.$$\nThe solution to the optimal portfolio choice problem is:\n$$\\omega^*_{\\gamma}  = \\frac{1}{\\gamma}\\left(\\Sigma^{-1} - \\frac{1}{\\iota' \\Sigma^{-1}\\iota }\\Sigma^{-1}\\iota\\iota' \\Sigma^{-1} \\right) \\mu  + \\frac{1}{\\iota' \\Sigma^{-1} \\iota }\\Sigma^{-1} \\iota.$$\nEmpirically, this classical solution imposes many problems. \nIn particular, the estimates of $\\mu$ are noisy over short horizons, the ($N \\times N$) matrix $\\Sigma$ contains $N(N-1)/2$ distinct elements and thus, estimation error is huge. \nSeminal papers on the effect of ignoring estimation uncertainty, among others, are @Brown1976, @Jobson1980, @Jorion1986, and @Chopra1993.\n\nEven worse, if the asset universe contains more assets than available time periods $(N > T)$, the sample covariance matrix is no longer positive definite such that the inverse $\\Sigma^{-1}$ does not exist anymore. \nTo address estimation issues for vast-dimensional covariance matrices, regularization techniques are a popular tool [see, e.g., @Ledoit2003; @Ledoit2004; @Ledoit2012; @Fan2008].\\index{Covariance}\n\nWhile the uncertainty associated with estimated parameters is challenging, the data-generating process is also unknown to the investor. In other words, model uncertainty reflects that it is ex-ante not even clear which parameters require estimation (for instance, if returns are driven by a factor model, selecting the universe of relevant factors imposes model uncertainty). @Wang2005 and @Garlappi2007 provide theoretical analysis on optimal portfolio choice under model *and* estimation uncertainty. In the most extreme case, @Pflug2012 shows that the naive portfolio which allocates equal wealth to all assets is the optimal choice for an investor averse to model uncertainty.\\index{Model uncertainty}\n\nOn top of the estimation uncertainty, *transaction costs* are a major concern.\\index{Transaction cost} \nRebalancing portfolios is costly, and, therefore, the optimal choice should depend on the investor's current holdings. In the presence of transaction costs, the benefits of reallocating wealth may be smaller than the costs associated with turnover. This aspect has been investigated theoretically, among others, for one risky asset by @Magill1976 and @Davis1990. Subsequent extensions to the case with multiple assets have been proposed by @Balduzzi1999 and @Balduzzi2000. More recent papers on empirical approaches which explicitly account for transaction costs include @Garleanu2013, and @DeMiguel2014, and @DeMiguel2015. \n\n## Estimation Uncertainty and Transaction Costs\n\nThe empirical evidence regarding the performance of a mean-variance optimization procedure in which you simply plug in some sample estimates $\\hat \\mu$ and $\\hat \\Sigma$ can be summarized rather briefly: mean-variance optimization performs poorly! The literature discusses many proposals to overcome these empirical issues. For instance, one may impose some form of regularization of $\\Sigma$, rely on Bayesian priors inspired by theoretical asset pricing models [@Kan2007] or use high-frequency data to improve forecasting [@Hautsch2015].\nOne unifying framework that works easily, effectively (even for large dimensions), and is purely inspired by economic arguments is an ex-ante adjustment for transaction costs [@Hautsch2019]. \n\nAssume that returns are from a multivariate normal distribution with mean $\\mu$ and variance-covariance matrix $\\Sigma$, $N(\\mu,\\Sigma)$. Additionally, we assume quadratic transaction costs which penalize rebalancing such that  $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\nu\\left(\\omega_{t+1},\\omega_{t^+}, \\beta\\right) = \\frac{\\beta}{2} \\left(\\omega_{t+1} - \\omega_{t^+}\\right)'\\left(\\omega_{t+1}- \\omega_{t^+}\\right),\\end{aligned}$$\nwith cost parameter $\\beta>0$ and $\\omega_{t^+} = {\\omega_t \\circ  (1 +r_{t})}/{\\iota' (\\omega_t \\circ (1 + r_{t}))}$. $\\omega_{t^+}$ denotes the portfolio weights just before rebalancing. Note that $\\omega_{t^+}$ differs mechanically from $\\omega_t$ due to the returns in the past period.\nIntuitively, transaction costs penalize portfolio performance when the portfolio is shifted from the current holdings $\\omega_{t^+}$ to a new allocation $\\omega_{t+1}$. \nIn this setup, transaction costs do not increase linearly. Instead, larger rebalancing is penalized more heavily than small adjustments. \nThen, the optimal portfolio choice for an investor with mean variance preferences is\n$$\\begin{aligned}\\omega_{t+1} ^* &=  \\arg\\max \\omega'\\mu - \\nu_t (\\omega,\\omega_{t^+}, \\beta) - \\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\omega'\\Sigma\\omega \\text{ s.t. } \\iota'\\omega = 1\\\\\n&=\\arg\\max\n\\omega'\\mu^* - \\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\omega'\\Sigma^* \\omega \\text{ s.t.} \\iota'\\omega=1,\\end{aligned}$$\nwhere\n$$\\mu^*=\\mu+\\beta \\omega_{t^+} \\quad  \\text{and} \\quad \\Sigma^*=\\Sigma + \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma} I_N.$$\nAs a result, adjusting for transaction costs implies a standard mean-variance optimal portfolio choice with adjusted return parameters $\\Sigma^*$ and $\\mu^*$: $$\\omega^*_{t+1} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma}\\left(\\Sigma^{*-1} - \\frac{1}{\\iota' \\Sigma^{*-1}\\iota }\\Sigma^{*-1}\\iota\\iota' \\Sigma^{*-1} \\right) \\mu^*  + \\frac{1}{\\iota' \\Sigma^{*-1} \\iota }\\Sigma^{*-1} \\iota.$$\n\nAn alternative formulation of the optimal portfolio can be derived as follows: \n$$\\omega_{t+1} ^*=\\arg\\max\n\\omega'\\left(\\mu+\\beta\\left(\\omega_{t^+} - \\frac{1}{N}\\iota\\right)\\right) - \\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\omega'\\Sigma^* \\omega \\text{ s.t. } \\iota'\\omega=1.$$\nThe optimal weights correspond to a mean-variance portfolio, where the vector of expected returns is such that assets that currently exhibit a higher weight are considered as delivering a higher expected return. \n\n## Optimal Portfolio Choice\n\nThe function below implements the efficient portfolio weight in its general form, allowing for transaction costs (conditional on the holdings *before* reallocation). \nFor $\\beta=0$, the computation resembles the standard mean-variance efficient framework. `gamma` denotes the coefficient of risk aversion $\\gamma$, `beta` is the transaction cost parameter $\\beta$ and `w_prev` are the weights before rebalancing $\\omega_{t^+}$. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncompute_efficient_weight <- function(Sigma,\n                                     mu,\n                                     gamma = 2,\n                                     beta = 0, # transaction costs\n                                     w_prev = rep(\n                                       1 / ncol(Sigma),\n                                       ncol(Sigma)\n                                     )) {\n  iota <- rep(1, ncol(Sigma))\n  Sigma_processed <- Sigma + beta / gamma * diag(ncol(Sigma))\n  mu_processed <- mu + beta * w_prev\n\n  Sigma_inverse <- solve(Sigma_processed)\n\n  w_mvp <- Sigma_inverse %*% iota\n  w_mvp <- as.vector(w_mvp / sum(w_mvp))\n  w_opt <- w_mvp + 1 / gamma *\n    (Sigma_inverse - w_mvp %*% t(iota) %*% Sigma_inverse) %*%\n      mu_processed\n  return(as.vector(w_opt))\n}\n\ncompute_efficient_weight(Sigma, mu)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1]  1.395  0.293 -1.391  0.477  0.363 -0.320  0.545  0.446 -0.132\n[10] -0.675\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe portfolio weights above indicate the efficient portfolio for an investor with risk aversion coefficient $\\gamma=2$ in absence of transaction costs. Some of the positions are negative which implies short-selling, most of the positions are rather extreme. For instance, a position of $-1$ implies that the investor takes a short position worth her entire wealth to lever long positions in other assets. \\index{Short-selling}\nWhat is the effect of transaction costs or different levels of risk aversion on the optimal portfolio choice?

The higher the transaction costs parameter $\\beta$, the smaller is the rebalancing from the initial portfolio. In addition, if risk aversion $\\gamma$ increases, the efficient portfolio is closer to the minimum variance portfolio weights such that the investor desires less rebalancing from the initial holdings. \n\n## Constrained Optimization\n\nNext, we introduce constraints to the above optimization procedure. \nVery often, typical constraints such as short-selling restrictions prevent analytical solutions for optimal portfolio weights (short-selling restrictions simply imply that negative weights are not allowed such that we require that $w_i \\geq 0 \\forall i$). \nHowever, numerical optimization allows computing the solutions to such constrained problems. For the purpose of mean-variance optimization, we rely on the `solve.QP()` function from the package `quadprog`.\\index{Optimization!Constrained}\n\nThe function `solve.QP()` delivers numerical solutions to quadratic programming problems of the form \n$$\\min(-\\mu \\omega + 1/2 \\omega' \\Sigma \\omega) \\text{ s.t. } A' \\omega >= b_0.$$\nThe function takes one argument (`meq`) for the number of equality constraints. Therefore, the above matrix $A$ is simply a vector of ones to ensure that the weights sum up to one. In the case of short-selling constraints, the matrix $A$ is of the form \n$$A' = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1& \\ldots&1 \\\\1 & 0 &\\ldots&0\\\\0 & 1 &\\ldots&0\\\\\\vdots&&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\0&0&\\ldots&1\\end{pmatrix}'\\qquad b_0 = \\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\\\\\vdots\\\\0\\end{pmatrix}.$$\n\nBefore we dive into constrained optimization, we revisit the *unconstrained* problem and replicate the analytical solutions for the minimum variance and efficient portfolio weights from above. We verify that the output is equal to the above solution. \nNote that `near()` is a safe way to compare two vectors for pairwise equality. The alternative `==` is sensitive to small differences that may occur due to the representation of floating points on a computer, while `near()` has a built-in tolerance. As just discussed, we set `Amat` to a matrix with a column of ones and `bvec` to 1 to enforce the constraint that weights must sum up to one. `meq=1` means that one (out of one) constraints must be satisfied with equality.   \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nw_mvp_numerical <- solve.QP(\n  Dmat = Sigma,\n  dvec = rep(0, n_industries),\n  Amat = cbind(rep(1, n_industries)),\n  bvec = 1,\n  meq = 1\n)\n\nall(near(w_mvp, w_mvp_numerical$solution))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nw_efficient_numerical <- solve.QP(\n  Dmat = 2 * Sigma,\n  dvec = mu,\n  Amat = cbind(rep(1, n_industries)),\n  bvec = 1,\n  meq = 1\n)\n\nall(near(compute_efficient_weight(Sigma, mu), w_efficient_numerical$solution))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe result above shows that indeed the numerical procedure recovered the optimal weights for a scenario, where we already know the analytic solution. \nFor more complex optimization routines, [R's optimization task view](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Optimization.html) provides an overview of the vast optimization landscape. \\index{Optimization}\n\nNext, we approach problems where no analytical solutions exist. First, we additionally impose short-sale constraints, which implies $N$ inequality constraints of the form $w_i >=0$. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nw_no_short_sale <- solve.QP(\n  Dmat = 2 * Sigma,\n  dvec = mu,\n  Amat = cbind(1, diag(n_industries)),\n  bvec = c(1, rep(0, n_industries)),\n  meq = 1\n)\nw_no_short_sale$solution\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] 5.17e-01 3.06e-18 2.05e-16 7.90e-02 0.00e+00 2.65e-17 1.48e-01\n [8] 2.56e-01 8.74e-18 0.00e+00\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nAs expected, the resulting portfolio weights are all positive (up to numerical precision). Typically, the holdings in the presence of short-sale constraints are concentrated among way fewer assets than for the unrestricted case. \nYou can verify that `sum(w_no_short_sale$solution)` returns 1. In other words: `solve.QP()` provides the numerical solution to a portfolio choice problem for a mean-variance investor with risk aversion `gamma = 2`, where negative holdings are forbidden. \n\n`solve.QP()` is fast because it benefits from a very clear problem structure with a quadratic objective and linear constraints. However, optimization often requires more flexibility. As an example, we show how to compute optimal weights, subject to the so-called [Regulation T-constraint,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_T) which requires that the sum of all absolute portfolio weights is smaller than 1.5, that is $\\sum_{i=1}^N |w_i| \\leq 1.5$. \nThe constraint enforces that a maximum of 50 percent of the allocated wealth can be allocated to short positions, thus implying an initial margin requirement of 50 percent. Imposing such a margin requirement reduces portfolio risks because extreme portfolio weights are not attainable anymore. The implementation of Regulation-T rules is numerically interesting because the margin constraints imply a non-linear constraint on the portfolio weights. \\index{Regulation T}\nThus, we can no longer rely on `solve.QP()`, which is defined as solving quadratic programming problems with linear constraints. \nInstead, we rely on the package `alabama`, which requires a separate definition of objective and constraint functions. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninitial_weights <- rep(\n  1 / n_industries,\n  n_industries\n)\n\nobjective <- function(w, gamma = 2) {\n  -t(w) %*% (1 + mu) +\n    gamma / 2 * t(w) %*% Sigma %*% w\n}\n\ninequality_constraints <- function(w, reg_t = 1.5) {\n  reg_t - sum(abs(w))\n}\n\nequality_constraints <- function(w) {\n  sum(w) - 1\n}\n\nw_reg_t <- constrOptim.nl(\n  par = initial_weights,\n  hin = inequality_constraints,\n  fn = objective,\n  heq = equality_constraints,\n  control.outer = list(trace = FALSE)\n)\nw_reg_t$par\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1]  3.41e-01 -1.29e-05 -1.08e-01  1.40e-01  7.32e-02 -1.13e-02\n [7]  2.47e-01  3.14e-01  1.33e-01 -1.29e-01\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that the function `constrOptim.nl()` requires a starting vector of parameter values, i.e., an initial portfolio.

We consider 120 periods from the past to update the parameter estimates before recomputing portfolio weights. Then, we update portfolio weights which is costly and affects the performance. The portfolio weights determine the portfolio return. A period later, the current portfolio weights have changed and form the foundation for transaction costs incurred in the next period. We consider three different competing strategies: the mean-variance efficient portfolio, the mean-variance efficient portfolio with ex-ante adjustment for transaction costs, and the naive portfolio, which allocates wealth equally across the different assets.\\index{Transaction cost}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwindow_length <- 120\nperiods <- nrow(industry_returns) - window_length\n\nbeta <- 50\ngamma <- 2\n\nperformance_values <- matrix(NA,\n  nrow = periods,\n  ncol = 3\n)\ncolnames(performance_values) <- c(\"raw_return\", \"turnover\", \"net_return\")\n\nperformance_values <- list(\n  \"MV (TC)\" = performance_values,\n  \"Naive\" = performance_values,\n  \"MV\" = performance_values\n)\n\nw_prev_1 <- w_prev_2 <- w_prev_3 <- rep(\n  1 / n_industries,\n  n_industries\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe also define two helper functions: one to adjust the weights due to returns and one for performance evaluation, where we compute realized returns net of transaction costs. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nadjust_weights <- function(w, next_return) {\n  w_prev <- 1 + w * next_return\n  as.numeric(w_prev / sum(as.vector(w_prev)))\n}\n\nevaluate_performance <- function(w, w_previous, next_return, beta = 50) {\n  raw_return <- as.matrix(next_return) %*% w\n  turnover <- sum(abs(w - w_previous))\n  net_return <- raw_return - beta / 10000 * turnover\n  c(raw_return, turnover, net_return)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe following code chunk performs a rolling-window estimation, which we implement in a loop.

Turnover is huge when the investor only considers her portfolio's expected return and variance. Effectively, the mean-variance portfolio generates a *negative* annualized return after adjusting for transaction costs. At the same time, the naive portfolio turns out to perform very well. In fact, the performance gains of the transaction-cost adjusted mean-variance portfolio are small. The out-of-sample Sharpe ratio is slightly higher than for the naive portfolio. Note the extreme effect of turnover penalization on turnover: *MV (TC)* effectively resembles a buy-and-hold strategy which only updates the portfolio once the estimated parameters $\\hat\\mu_t$ and $\\hat\\Sigma_t$indicate that the current allocation is too far away from the optimal theoretical portfolio. \n\n## Exercises\n\n1. Consider the portfolio choice problem for transaction-cost adjusted certainty equivalent maximization with risk aversion parameter $\\gamma$ \n$$\\omega_{t+1} ^* =  \\arg\\max_{\\omega \\in \\mathbb{R}^N,  \\iota'\\omega = 1} \\omega'\\mu - \\nu_t (\\omega, \\beta) - \\frac{\\gamma}{2}\\omega'\\Sigma\\omega$$\nwhere $\\Sigma$ and $\\mu$ are (estimators of) the variance-covariance matrix of the returns and the vector of expected returns. Assume for now that transaction costs are quadratic in rebalancing *and* proportional to stock illiquidity such that \n$$\\nu_t\\left(\\omega, B\\right) = \\frac{\\beta}{2} \\left(\\omega - \\omega_{t^+}\\right)'B\\left(\\omega - \\omega_{t^+}\\right)$$ where $B = \\text{diag}(ill_1, \\ldots, ill_N)$ is a diagonal matrix, where $ill_1, \\ldots, ill_N$. Derive a closed-form solution for the mean-variance efficient portfolio $\\omega_{t+1} ^*$ based on the transaction cost specification above. Discuss the effect of illiquidity $ill_i$ on the individual portfolio weights relative to an investor that myopically ignores transaction costs in her decision. \n1. Use the solution from the previous exercise to update the function `compute_efficient_weight()` such that you can compute optimal weights conditional on a matrix $B$ with illiquidity measures. \n1. Illustrate the evolution of the *optimal* weights from the naive portfolio to the efficient portfolio in the mean-standard deviation diagram.\n1. Is it always optimal to choose the same $\\beta$ in the optimization problem than the value used in evaluating the portfolio performance? In other words: can it be optimal to choose theoretically sub-optimal portfolios based on transaction cost considerations that do not reflect the actual incurred costs? Evaluate the out-of-sample Sharpe ratio after transaction costs for a range of different values of imposed $\\beta$ values.",
