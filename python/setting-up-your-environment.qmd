title: Setting Up Your Python Environment

We aim to lower the bar for starting empirical research in financial economics. We want that using Python is easy for you. However, given that Tidy Finance is a platform that supports multiple programming languages, we also consider the possibility that you are not familiar with Python at all. Maybe you transition from R to Python, i.e., follow the journey of Tidy Finance, which started in R. Hence, we provide you with a simple guide to get started with Python. If you were not using Python before, you will be able to use it after reading this chapter.

## Python Environment Installation

A Python environment is a self-contained directory or folder containing a specific version of the Python interpreter and a set of packages and dependencies. In order to isolate and manage the specific dependencies of the Tidy Finance with Python project, a virtual environment is a reliable way to ensure that it will work consistently and reliably on different systems and with different versions of packages.

First, we need to install Python itself via Anaconda. You can download the latest version of Anaconda from the official [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). After you downloaded the respective version for you operating system, follow the installation instructions.

Second, we now describe how to set up a Python 3.10 virtual environment specific for Tidy Finance on your local system. Therefore, we use the Anaconda Python distribution you downloaded in the step before. Additionally, you need our [requirements.txt](https://github.com/tidy-finance/website/blob/main/requirements.txt)-file in a dedicated folder for the project. Note that you could skip the packages' installation at this point, but we recommend you start with them right away. After you prepared your system you can open the Anaconda prompt and install your virtual environment with the following commands:

1. `conda create -p C:\Apps\Anaconda3\envs\tidy_finance_environment python==3.10  (Confirm with y)`
2. `conda activate C:\Apps\Anaconda3\envs\tidy_finance_environment`
3. `pip install -r "<Tidy-Finanye-with-Python Folder>\requirements.txt"`

Note: All other packages found with the command pip list are installed automatically as dependencies with the required packages in the requirements.txt file.

Now, you are basically ready to go. However, you will now need a Python interpreter to make your coding experience pleasant.

## Python Interpreter

If you are new to coding, you will not have a Python interpreter. We recommend using Spyder, if you plan on only coding in Python. You can download the software for your operating system from the [official website](https://www.spyder-ide.org/). Then, follow the installation instructions. To add the perviously created virtual environment to Spyder, Go to Tools → Preferences → Python Interpreter → "Use the following interpreter" and add `C:\Apps\Anaconda3\envs\tidy_finance_environment\python.exe`.

If you already work with R, you probably have a powerful Python interpreter already: RStudio.You can get your RStudio version from [Posit](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (i.e., the company that created RStudio, which was previously called RStudio itself). When you follow the instructions, you will see that Posit asks you to install R - you need to do so, to make RStudio feasible for Python. Then, select the virtual environment in RStudio.

Comment: Why is this so much nicer then the above?

1. `cd "<Tidy-Finanye-with-Python Folder>`
2. `conda create -p env python==3.10  (Confirm with y)`
3. `conda activate env/`
4. `conda install setuptools (Confirm with y)`
5. `pip install -r "requirements.txt"`
