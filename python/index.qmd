# Preface

::: {.callout-note}
You are reading the work-in-progress edition of **Tidy Finance with Python**. Code chunks and text might change over the next couple of months. We are always looking for feedback via [contact\@tidy-finance.org](mailto:contact@tidy-finance.org). Meanwhile, you can find the complete R version [here](../r/index.qmd).

## Why does this book exist?

Our book [Tidy Finance with R](../r/index.qmd) received great feedback from students and teachers alike. However, one of the most common feedback that we received was that many interested coders are constrained and have to use Python in their institution. We really love R for data analysis tasks, but we of course acknowledge the flexibility and popularity of Python. So we decided to increase our team of authors with a Python expert and translate our original work following the same tidy principles. 

## Why Tidy?

As you start working with data, you quickly realize that you spend a lot of time reading, cleaning, and transforming your data. In fact, it is often said that more than 80% of data analysis is spent on preparing data.
By *tidying data*, we want to structure data sets to facilitate further analyses.
As @Wickham2014 puts it:

> \[T\]idy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.
> Tidy datasets provide a standardized way to link the structure of a dataset (its physical layout) with its semantics (its meaning).

In its essence, tidy data follows these three principles:

1.  Every column is a variable.
2.  Every row is an observation.
3.  Every cell is a single value.

Throughout this book, we try to follow these principles as best as we can.
If you want to learn more about tidy data principles in an informal manner, we refer you to [this vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html) as part of @tidyr.

In addition to the data layer, there are also tidy coding principles outlined in [the tidy tools manifesto](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/articles/manifesto.html) that we try to follow:

1.  Reuse existing data structures.
2.  Compose simple functions with the pipe.
3.  Embrace functional programming.
4.  Design for humans.
